- NoSEO: Miki, it looks like you have copy-pasted the the thing below from one of your articles.
- Miki: Yes, you are right.
- NoSEO: Very wise, Miki. Very wise. Google loves duplicated content. The more times you post the same, the more 
  time will you appear on the top of the first page.
- Miki: Wow. Cool. I did not know that. Anything else I can do, to appear on the top of the first page?
- NoSEO: Sure. Please never ever set a canonical link in your duplicated posts.
- Miki: Why.
- Nikolai: Because cannonical links are for p.ssies.
- NoSEO: Because in case you set a canonical url to the original content, then google will only show the original 
  article on the top, and not the others.
- Miki: Oh, I see.
- Minnie: Guys! We have lost focus. That is not why we are here.
- Miki, Nikolai, NoSEO: Why are we here today?

## The Completely Flawed (IT) Job Market AKA The Completely Flawed (IT) Job Market
- McRuiter: We are here, to change the completely flawed (IT) Job Market.
- Miki: Wow. I like your ambition, McRuiter!
- Minnie: What a great idea.
- Nikolai: You are an IDIOT. With capital letters: I-D-I-O-T.
- Nikolai: Such cockiness.

- Miki: So what is the problem with the (IT) Job Market?
- McRuiter: The problem is the following:
 The companies think they are higher beings than software developers.
- Miki: What do you mean by that?
- McRuiter: They think, they give you a favour by employing you.
- Nikolai: That is the truth McRuiter. These (IT) companies are so kind they are willing to pay for the shit you do 
  under the name work. 
- Miki: Well, I do not completely agree with you, but please continue.
- McRuiter: So let's have a look at the interview process.
- Miki: Sure.
- McRuiter: First of all! The word interview is flawed too.
- Miki: Why?
- McRuiter: As an interview is a topdog-underdog situation. The people ae not equal, the interviewer leads the 
  conversation by asking questions.
- Minnie: But the developers can only have questions.
- McRuiter: Yeah, after answering a dozen questions, they can ask a few ones.
 So cause of this, interviews are like interrogations.
- Miki. What do you mean by that?
- McRuiter: You have to convince the (IT) Recruiter to be nice and give the job to you.
- Miki: However I was only on 2 interviews, I have not experienced this on my own skin, but I heard many examples 
  from fellow developers.
- Minnie: So what should we do?
- McRuiter: Instead of calling it an interrogation we should call it a conversation.
- Minnie: Do you think the name change would be enough?
- McRuiter: Of course not, but that is just the start.
- Miki: Interesting, McRuiter. Keep going.
- McRuiter: Of course. Not. Please, let me explain how the current process looks like.
- Miki: Sure.
- McRuiter: Large companies conducts 10+ rounds of interviews in order to find their perfect match for 
  a given position.
- Minnie: I heard that too.
- NonScienceish: Britishish Scentistishish has proven you cannot find your perfect match in less 
  tha 10 interviews.
- Miki: I only applied for a job at 2 companies up till know, but at both places there were only 1 round of interview.
- McRuiter: Wait. What? Only one round?
- Miki: Yes, actually at the first application I had 2 rounds, but the seond round was onéy about the CEO letting me 
  know I was the chosen one.
- Minnie: Why do you think it is happening?
- McRuiter: Because there are so many factors to consider when you would like to hire someone.
- Miki: So, what is the root cause of the problem.
- McRuiter: The problem is that companies have no idea who are you? They do not know value you can deliver to the 
  company.
- Minnie: But there is the CV.
- McRuiter: In case you write a more than one page long CV, your CV will land in the dustbin, as just imagine 
  reading 10000 CVs. It is not possible.
- Miki: But, CV is still a good thing right?
- McRuiter: Nope.
- Miki: Why?
- McRuiter: The man who comes from afar says what he wants.
- ManFromAfair: Java is my second mother tongue, and I also eat agile for breakfast.
- Miki: So what should we do in this situation?
- McRuiter: Developers have to share more information about themsleves using personal stories to prove it, or even 
  better, to answer my list of questions, which I have created only for one purpose:

 To makes sure developers can find a job in one single round of interview!

- Miki, Minnie, Nikolai, ManFromAfair, NoSEO: Whaaaaat?
- McRuiter: Yep. Only one round with the team and the CEO.
- Miki: I understand the team, but what about the CEO?
- McRuiter: Fish stinks from its head (fejétől bűzlik a hal in Hungarian).
- Miki: What do you mean by that?
- McRuiter: A company is exactly as good as the CEO.
- Miki: Interesting thoughts. Can you share the list with us?
- McRuiter: Sure! I have created a list, to make sure I can recommend good candidates to your partner company DMG 
  MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. 
- McMuck: I smell money here. Sign up bonus you beauty. You are the love of my love.
- Nikolai: So, you want to get money from recommending developers to DMG MORI Heitec Digital Kft.?
- McRuiter: Sure. It is a win-win-win situation. It is good for the developer, for the company and also for me. 
  Win-win-win 
  situations are very rare nowadays.
- So here is the list. You can simply copy paste it and change the company name to your company.

## MCRuiter's Dream AKA The Perfectisch Matchish Partnershipish Opportunityish for Companieishish AKA The Great (IT) Job Market Refactor

## 0. How much money you ask for in exchange for your expertise?
- Minnie: But they do not even know anything about you. How can you say a salary?
- McRuiter: It is simple. My professionalism not dependent on what they are thinking about me.
- Minnie: So why is this the 0th?
- McRuiter: First of all it is because I added it at then end and I was not in the mood to fix that, secondly, but more imprtatantly like companies we are living from money and as there are no venture capitals who finance us, our main income is our salary. I do not want to waste your and my time, in case we are way off regarding salary.
## 1. What do you know about DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft.?
- Minnie: What happens if I do not know anything about DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft.?
- McRuiter: Well, then we stop.
- Minnie: Really? That was all?
- Nikolai: I knew it is a scam.
- McRuiter: for a few minutes and I will tell you about the company. But I would be happy, if you would do some reasearch, as why would you like to work at a company about you know nothing.
  Here are some links, where you can start: [DMG-MORI](https://msz.team/3LLz3eH), [LinkedIn](https://msz.team/3DPoKU9), [Facebook](https://msz.team/35SRpLG), [Adamos](https://msz.team/3x8ChVy).
  We even have a short video about or office. I think it is pretty cool, you can even see where I was sitting at 
  that time. Just pause at 1:03 and my chair is to the right of the ball right beside the window.
- Nikolai: Nobody cares where were you sitting McRuiter.
- McRuiter: Nobody asked you Nikolai.

  ROI. [Please click here!](https://msz.team/3DVW9g8)

  -Minnie: So what is the next on the list?
  -Mictor:
## 2. Please draw something for me!
- McRuiter: Hey Mictor! Have you realized it is me who is listing the elements?
- Mictor: Sure, but this one is so important.
- McRuiter: Why?
- Mictor: To also have some fun.
- Nikolai: This is an interview! It should not be fun! What did you think? Did you imagine you go to your workplace every day and just have chitchating and having fun during working?
- McRuiter, Minnie, Mictor: This is a friendly talk not an intrview, and yes, we definitely would like to have fun during work.
- Mictor: You cannot interrupt an artist, so I continue. All of us has a child inside, and the perfect time to awake it is as soon as possible.
- McRuiter: Fair enough. We will keep it.
  However nobody asked for it (yet), I would like to state: this article only contains McRuiter, Minnie, Nikolai, Uncle Nikolaus and Mictor Szeles's personal opinin about recruiters, developers, technolgoies and about everyhting else in the world. It is not related to DMG MORI HEITEC DIGITAL Kft at all. I did not asked for their permission to post it, as I know DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. respects personal opinions.
## 3. What is your first memorable moment related to your profession?
- Minnie: Why is this important?
- McRuiter: I want to let you know I am mostly interested in you as a human not as a professional.
## 4. What is your worst moment related to your profession?
- Nikolai: That is non of your business. I will never tell it to you as you will turn it against me.
- McRuiter: Ummm Nikolai. It is completely fine not answering this question, but rest assured I won't tell this info to anyone, except you approve it.

- Nikolai: I guess the next one is how many Hackerrank exercises you solved in how much time?
- McRuiter: No, it is not.
- Nikolai: Why?
- McRuiter: Because I do not care.
- Nikolai: McRuiter you won't take me for a fool again. Measuring with a stopwatch how many Hackerrank like excersies a developer can solve is the internationally accepted de facto standard for measuring a developer's talent.
- McRuiter: Sure Nikolai. Sure.
- Nikolai: I am serious McRuiter. Just look around in the world!!! This must have to be the best approach as so many companies doing it.
- McRuiter: Well, you must be right, but I would like to tell you, in case I will ever interview you I will not ask you to solve multiple tasks in a very limited time.
- Nikolai: So what would you do then?
  McRuiter: Either I would not ask you to do anything like that (espeially in case you already provided the link to your GitHub repo), or I would give you one single task.
- Nikolai: One single task?
- McRuiter: Yeah. One single task is completely enough to measure whether you can understand and analyze a problem, and also to see whether you can design, implement and test a solution.
- Nikolai: And what if I got stuck?
- McRuiter: Then I would do what I would do if you would be my padawan.
- Nikolai: What would you do?
- McRuiter: I would help you to find the answer for yourself following your own thinking but getting some hints from me.
  But luckily we are not on an interview, so I would ask this:
## 5. Please show me your favourite code snippet and tell a few words about it!
- Minnie: I don't have a favourite code snipet McRuiter. What should I show you?
- McRuiter: Me neither. Ok, then what about showing your favourite app, open source project, art, writing or whatever you consider favourite.
- Minnie: That sounds great McRuiter.
## 6. Are you smoking?
- Nikolai: You cannot ask that on an interview! I guess you want to filter smokers, as they do not work as much as non-smoker develoepers.
- McRuiter: This is not an interview this is a converse. I would like to know, how much possibilty we will have for some professional discussion. But I won't forward this info to Geri.
## 7. Do you have a blog?
- Minnie: I do have a blog, McRuiter.
- McRuiter: Where is it?
- Minnie: Here.[Here](https://msz.team/3v78JoS)!
- McRuiter:  But that is mine.
- Minnie: Ours McRuiter. Ours. Why do you want to know that?
- McRuiter: Cause I am interested in you. I would like to know what subjects are you interested, how is your style.
## 8. Have you contributed to open-source in any way?
- Minnie: McRuiter, I did not contributed. Is that a problem?
- McRuiter: Definitely not. But then I will tell you about [Selenidium Element Insperctor Bounty Hunting Reward Program](https://msz.team/3uhtkYa) which is the perfect opportunity to put your feet on the filed of open-source. I personally guarantee that a very helpful, openminded pprofessional team will support you in this, and you can also have some ☕ with me.
- Minnie: That is lovely. Where can I contribute? Either on [GitHub](https://msz.team/3v2HJqe) or on the [Selenideium Element Inspector Twitter channel](https://msz.team/38rUF1f).
## 9. What are the top 3 thing you value the most in your life?
- Nikolai: Why the hell do you want to know that?
- McRuiter: As I am interested in you as a person.
## 10. What are the top 3 thing you cannot stand in other people?
- Nikolai: You McRuiter, you.
- McRuiter: It is mutual Nikolai.
- Minnie: Why do you want to know that?
- McRuiter: Because I want to make sure that you will not face them at the company.
## 11. Who is your favourite fictional character? Why?
- Minnie: My favourite character is Smurfette(Törpilla in Hungarian).
- McRuiter: Cool, I also love the six thinking smurfs.
- Minnie: What is that?
- McRuiter: You will find out soon. 😊
- Nikolai: It is strange but one of my favourite character is also a Smurf.
- McRuiter: Really? I never thought you have something called favourite in your life.
- Nikolai: It is Grouchy Smurf(Dulifuli in Hungarian).
- McRuiter: And who is the other?
- Nikolai: Grumpy from the Snowwhite and The Seven Dwarves. Of course.
- Mictor: What a coincidence. My favourite character is also from the Smurfs. It is Painter Smurf. He is such an artist. I love him almost as much as myself.
- McRuiter: [Pierre Culliford (Peyo)](https://msz.team/3Kvg3Ri) is a genius!
## 12. Who is your favourite real life idol? Why?
- Minnie: I cannot tell right now, but why this is interesting?
- McRuiter: As I would like to widen my view and find people worthwile to follow.
## 13. What are the top 3 things which motivate you to stay in a company?
- Minnie: Empathy, empathy and empathy.
- Nikolai: To respect my professional opinion and to leave me alone.
- McRuiter: That was only 2. What is your heard Nikolai?
- Nikolai: No fruits, tablesoccer, breakfast, Xbox, PS and of course big big money.
- Mictor: To fill the office with my art, so I can feel myself at home.
- Unclue Nicholaus: Elf-free zone, warm weather and of course Christmas presents.
- Minnie: Listen, McRuiter! I know you stole this from DMG MORI HEITEC Digital's HR expert [Geri Molnár](https://bit.ly/3iGyR3P)!
- McRuiter: You are right. We only talked for less than an hour in total and I learnt so many things from him.
- Minnie: What else?
- McRuiter: Asking for your top 3 best and worst attributes worth nothing.
- Minnie: I agree, but why?
- McRuiter: Because you can google the "right" answers in less then 5 minutes.
- Minnie: What else did you learn from him?
- McRuiter: Interviews can be enjoyable conversations.
- Minnie: I like that. Anything else?
- McRuiter: Not right now, but as I said we only talked in a formalish way for less than an hour.
## 14. What are the top 3 things which motivate you to leave the company?
- Minnie: In case I cannot bring in my dog and my flowers that is definitely the top one.
- Nikolai: I don't care. I will quit anyway.
- Uncle Nikolaus: No Christmas tree. No presents.
- Mictor: If I am not allowed to perk up the office with my beautiful art. That is definitely a reason to break up.
## 15. Do you speak Hungarian?
- Minnie: Hungarian is a beautiful language, but why it is important in an international company?
- McRuiter: We are the Hungarian department. Most of our people are Hungarians, we have many documents in Hungarian.
- Nikolai: So in case I do not speak Hungarian you won't employ me?
- McRuiter: I can't tell for sure, but I know about a case where this one of the reasons was the lack of Hungarian knowledge.
- Minnie: What was it?
- McRuiter: We have a recommendation system. First of all the developer gets a sign up bonus after the probation period, and also the person who recommended him will get a bonus depending on the seniority level of the new teammate.
  So I recommended my former student Reza who is a developer from Persia. Unfortunatelly, he has a very limited Hungarian knowledge, so I got the feedback that he won't be employed for 2 reasons. We were not looking for junior developer at that time and also because he cannot speak Hungarian well enough.
- Minnie: I see. What do you recommend for those who do not speak Hungarian?
- McRuiter: To start learning Hungarian [start with this language lesson](https://msz.team/3NSYlJP).
## 16. Do you play Fortnite or Among Us? Anything else?
- Minnie: I love Among Us. It is pretty funny to play it with the family. We even play it in real life.
- Nikolai: Games are for kids.
- Uncle Nikolaus: Which game you want for Christmas kids?
- Mictor: The best game is Microsoft Illustrator.
## 17. What are those 3 things which we did not talk about but you consider important to share it with me?
- Minnie: I love chocolate cakes.
- Nikolai: I love Minnie.
- McRuiter, Minnie: What?
- Nikolai: I mean I hate you all.
- Mictor: I can express myself in the language of photograpy and also writing recently.
## 18. Do you want to have a direct channel to the CEO?
- Minnie: Sure, but who is your CEO?
- McRuiter: He is [Péter Várady](https://msz.team/3JmeYKm).
- Minnie: I have never heard that name before.
- McRuiter: Me niether, before I joined DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. But I very quickly learned it after I joined DMG MORI HEITEC DIGITAL Kft.
- Minnie: Why.
- McRuiter: I got to know he was the former CEO of Evosoft Hungary. He built a more than 1000 people company from a few hundred.
- Minnie: Wow. That's amazing.
- McRuiter: But that is not all.
- Minnie: What else?
- McRuiter: He did not come alone. Many of the managers followed him. And then many of the inferiors of these managers also.
- Minnie: Wow. I believe that is whom people call a true leader.
- McRuiter: I think so. I think so.
- Nikolai: Many companies advertising themselves with these "Direct channel to the SEO" slogan, but in reality it never works.
- McRuiter: This time it works.
- Nikolai: How do you know that?
- McRuiter: You now Nikolai, I am a tester. So I tested it.
- Nikolai: What do you mean by that?
- McRuiter: We had a recent miscommunication issue, which escalated very quickly to a very high level. Even from this you can see, in this company you do not have to wait for weeks to get an answer to your email. In the end a decision has been made what I couldn't accept, so I wrote an honest and respectful email to Péter Várady who is the CEO of  DMG MORI HEITEC DIGITAL Kft. as I mentioned earlier.
- Nikolia: I guess his assistant sent an answer to you right?
- McRuiter: No. He answered with an honest and respectful email in a half day.
- Nikolai: I have to admit, even myself consider that respectful. I guess he did not fulfill your wish.
- McRuiter: The CEO of DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. considered my arguments and he changed his mind.
- Nikolai: What?
- McRuiter: The leader of DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. considered my arguments and he changed his mind.
- Nikolai: No way! That is to good to be true!
- Minnie: Such a leader.
- Uncle Nikolaus: I don't have a boss, but now I want one.
- Mictor: Can I feel the office with joy and color by ornamenting the walls of the office with my art?
## 19. Do you want to give and get feedback frequently?
- Minnie: Oh, I love to express my feelings. I want to work in a company where they are emphatic.
- Nikolai: Feedback is for pus*ies.! And I don't have feelings anyway.
- Uncle Nicholaus: I cannot live without giving feedback. Those Elf's are bastards. Last time one of my son thought he is a human and he went to New York to find his father.
- McRuiter: That is my favourite movie Uncle Nicholaus.
- Mictor: Who needs feedback!? My art speaks for itself, and noone can judge my art.
- Minnie: So what is the situation at DMG MORI HEITEC DIGITAL Kft.
## 20. Why do you want to work at DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft.?
- Minnie: Cause they allow to bring in your pets and plants.
- Nikolia: I will never work at DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft. Except I will. Then I will definitely work at DMG MORI HEITEC Digital Kft.
- Uncle Nikolaus: Sorry guys, I do not have time for that. Maybe next year. Maybe.
- Mictor: I would like to work for them as a photographer. It would be so much fun to photograph their next all company teambuilding.
- Minnie: But McRuiter, that is for what motivational letters are. British scientish proved, the only possible way to find out why you want to work with a company is to download a letter template, google for hours for the right answer, and then send it, instead of having a few sentence conversation. Just look around in the world.
- McRuiter: I think it is time to ask another favour.
- Minnie: Go on McRuiter!

Dear (IT) Recruiters! I would like to ask me a favour: I kindly ask you please never ask me to write a motivational letter, not because it is a bullshit, but because before you answer these questions listed here, I definitely won't join your team. Even then I will never write a motivational letter, but I can happily send the link to this article, but you have already checked it anyway before contacted me, so it doesn't make much sense.

- Minnie: That's all McRuiter? I answered all of your questions so I am in?
- McRuiter: Slow down Minnie. Slow done. You haven't even applied for the job.
- Minnie: Then why I had to answer your questions?
- McRuiter: First of all, you did not have to answer my questions. You can always choose the easier, faster, less fun way. You had to answer the questions for 2 reasons. One for you and one for me.
- Minnie: What is for me?
- McRuiter: If you answered the questions, then by now it became clear for you whether DMG MORI HEITEC DIGITAL Kft. might be the perfect match for you or not.
- Minnie: Fair enough. What is for you?
- McRuiter: Based on the answers and the potential upcoming conversation I can write my recommendation.
- Nikolai: Yeah, and you will tell Geri that I am a smoker and I will be rejected.
- McRuiter: I will never forward that information. In addition to that whenever I have written my recommendation I will show it to you and we will remove the parts you don't want to be included.
- Nikolia: Okayish.

- Miki: So how can developers send you their answers?
- McRuiter: Just send a DM on [LinkedIn](https://msz.team/3r7BIaQ) or [Twitter](https://msz.team/38rUF1f) to Miki, he will forward it to me.

- Minnie: So what will happen after you send my CV and your recommendation to Geri?
- McRuiter: We will talk about that later.
- Minnie: Do you think McRuiter can refatctor the (IT) Job Market on his own?
- McRuiter: Nope, but I am in touch with many (IT) Recruiters, so I will send this document for more than 30 (IT) 
  recruiter.
- Minnie: Wow. That is a great start I would say. Anything else?
- McRuiter: I have a created a template for the conversation. [Just click here and fill it!](https://msz.team/3JjrslQ)
