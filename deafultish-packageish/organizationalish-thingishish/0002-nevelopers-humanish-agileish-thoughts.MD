## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 1: Happy Agile

Software development is a marathon.

You will never reach your goal if you sprint all the time.

Sprint is good for increasing your endurance.

Instead of sprints, you should have enjoyable runs and more often joyful walks.

You will achieve amazing results if you focus on the happiness of your team.

## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 3: The Non Scrum Retrospective AKA The Walky Retro

At Miki, Minnie, Nikolai, and Co. we have 15 minutes to 3 hours long iterations called walks.

After each iteration/walk, we have a walky retro. Cause of this we do not need a multiple hours long Scrum retrospective.

When we are working together with other people we have the Daily Retro to make their life easier, as they already got used to the daily.
