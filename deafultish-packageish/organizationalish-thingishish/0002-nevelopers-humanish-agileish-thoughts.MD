## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 1: Feel Good Agile

Software development is a marathon.

You will never reach your goal if you sprint all the time.

Sprint is good for increasing your endurance.

Instead of sprints, you should have enjoyable runs and more often joyful walks.

You will achieve amazing results if you focus on the happiness of your team.

## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 2: Daily Retro

Team member:
What made me feel good?
What made me feel bad?
What can be done to make me feel better?

Feel good manager AKA Scrumish masterish after each teammate's sentences:
What can I do for you?

## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 3: The Non Scrum Retrospective AKA The Walky Retro

At Miki, Minnie, Nikolai, and Co. we have 15 minutes to 3 hours long iterations called walks.

After each iteration/walk, we have a walky retro. Cause of this we do not need a multiple hours long Scrum retrospective.

When we are working together with other people we have the Daily Retro to make their life easier, as they already got used to the daily.

## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 4: The Non-Cross-functional Team AKA Cross-functionalish Duos


Believe me. We tried it. We have asked McRuiter our HR expert to find cross-functional people. First, we asked him to find Product Masters who are Scrum Masters and Product Owners at the same time.

He failed miserably.

All of them told us, they cannot wear two hats at the same time, but we wanted them to wear multiple hats, as we are a huge fan of Edward de Bono's six thinking hat method and we are an even bigger fan of Peyo's hundred thinking Smurfs methodish.

Then we asked him to find cross-functional software developers.

We were lucky, as we had many candidates who said they are experts in everything like Word, Excel, frontend development, backend development, test automation, and everything else in the world. They knew all the hundred buzzwords by heart which was put into our job ad.

We found out about most of them had very shallow knowledge in those fields. But British scientists have proven you cannot be a software developer in 2022 if you are not an expert in at least thirty current technologies and of course also in technologies which will be released in the future.

Of course, we were looking for juniors as you do not have to pay a ton of money for them.

Still. We had one candidate, who was really an expert in all the 51 technologies we used during the life of the project.

It is 51 as when a new fancy technology came we started to use that to follow the trends, but of course, we had no time to rewrite the code to get rid of those dozens of years old technologies, so by now, we have 51 technologies in our software.

And of course, we have many programming languages as we have to follow the trends.

Back then we started with C and C++ and we also developed a client in C#. We moved to Java and Python afterward but when they got outdated we moved to programming languages like Javascript, Objective C, and Ruby and we also moved from Excel tables to SQL.

Then of course software development evolved further and we had to use new fancy technologies to attract developers. Nobody wants to work with a 2-year-old framework. That is so lame. This is why we started to use Ruby, Go, Swift and Kotlin. We have started to use Mongo as it is much more effective to use it for reading and writing fields uniquely which are the main tasks needed for our software.

What about version control?

Version control is for the average people. We are looking into the future, not into the past.

Despite having 51 technologies in our job ad, McRuiter found a candidate who was potentially a perfectish matchish for our company.

McRuiter immediately invited him to an interview, he sent the date and time in an email. He sent back an email with one single word: Ok.

We were amazed, at how effective this guy was. No chit-chat, just a simple ok. Amazing.

Then the big date comes. Let me share the conversation.

McRuiter: Hi!
Polyhistorish: System.out.println("Hello world")
McRuiter: How do you feel today?
Polyhistorish: print('I do not have feelings')

I had to control myself, as I almost told him at this point "You are hired". Of course, we are looking for professionals who have no feelings. Feelings are for the average people. Anyway, we have only one Feel Good Master and he already has to deal with dozens of people.

The conversation continued:

McRuiter: What do you know about Miki, Minnie, Nikolai and Co.?
Polyhistorish: LOGGER.info("It depends.")

At this point, McMuck opened a bottle of champaign as he immediately knew we can earn a ton of money by offering his expertise as a consultant to other companies.
McRuiter knew his expertise was not enough for this situation, so he asked our expert MutWhy to continue the conversation.

MutWhy: But why?
Polyhistorish: Console.WriteLine("It depends.")

All the knowledgeable team members were convinced about Polyhistorish's expertise, but Nikolai just shook his head.

MutWhy: But why?
Polyhistorish: Console.WriteLine("It depends.")

This was the point when even Nikolai realized we did not just find an expert, but we found THE EXPERT.

McRuiter: You are hired!
Polyhistorish: console.log("I just came here to become an expert on interviewing")

We felt devastated. So that was the point we realized we have to come up with our own agile solution for the problem. Luckily agile is so agile no matter what you do, you can always say we just adapted agile to our own company's needs.

As we are doing Walky Retros (see Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 3 for details), we quickly came up with our company-specific solution for the problem.

We had to realize there is no single person in the world who is an expert in everything and also wants to work with us.

Instead of having a cross-functional team we have on-demand cross-functional duos.

We are trying to achieve to have 2 experts in each technology/domain.

Whenever we have a task, then we find the 2 team members who have the most knowledge related to the task, and they join their forces to solve it.

It is a good solution as in case one of the developers gets sick, goes on holiday, or leaves the company we can still have one developer who can continue with the task.

What about new technologies?

First, here at Miki, Minnie, Nikolai and Co. we are investing in our people by giving paid free days and conference tickets to them.

Last, but not least our solution for learning new things is called "Story Goal".

This post wanted to be a tweet, but somehow I couldn't fit it into 160 characters, but I do not want to consume your precious time anymore, so I will talk about story goals in an upcoming post.

## Neveloper's Humanish Agileish Thoughts No. 5: User Story
At Miki, Minnie, Nikolai, and Co. we started to use Scrum 8 years ago. During the years we have revisited each element of Scrum and adapted them to our needs.

As you could already realize we have tailored almost all elements of Scrum to our own needs, but the user story is an exception. During the years we have seen great value in them, so we kept them.

User stories are coming from the customers and written by the product owner (PO).

It is the PO's responsibility to clarify every question related to the user story and include it in the Jira (yes, we use Jira) story type issue.

At our company, user stories are the single source of truth. Developers write their code based on the story and testers test the code based on the story too.

However, we love Confluence we do not use it to write lengthy feature specifications there. We have every important thing specified in the story, so we can avoid text duplication.

Q: What if a story has a too lengthy specification?

A: Well, that is a story smell. If your story is too large, most probably you have to split it up into smaller stories.

Q: What if the story takes too much time to develop?

A: As you know instead of cross-functional teams, we have cross-functionalish duos (Thoughts No. 4) which means 2 people are working on one story together. We use subtasks to break larger stories into smaller digestible features. If needed then another walky duo can work on the same story to make sure we get ready earlier.

Q: What if a tester finds a bug and the developer tells it is a feature?

A: At Miki, Minnie, Nikolai, and Co. we do not spend hours for such stupid debates as the solution is simple. If it is in the specification then it is a feature, if not, then it is a bug. It is that simple.

Q: What if the bug is valuable?

A: Then the user story has to be updated or a new user story has to be created.
