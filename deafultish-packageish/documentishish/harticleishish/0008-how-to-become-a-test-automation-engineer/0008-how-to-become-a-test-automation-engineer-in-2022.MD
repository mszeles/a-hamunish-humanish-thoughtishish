Hello dear reader!

I am Miki Szeles, from Hungary. I am a software developer specializing in test automation. I have 15 years of professional experience in programming from which I spent the last 1,5 years as a test automation engineer.

From this article, you can learn how to become a test automation engineer. I will outline a complete path that can help you land your (first) job as a test automation engineer.

DISCLAIMER: There are no paid promotions in this article. As you might already know if you read my articles, I promote people, companies, frameworks, and tools I find valuable. In this article, I am sharing all ones I found valuable during my still ongoing journey to become a great test automation engineer.

I have recently read a  [great article from Dennis Gurock](https://www.testmo.com/guides/learning-test-automation) about how to become a test automation engineer. I highly recommend reading Dennis' article before continuing with this one.

Making decisions as a complete beginner can be overwhelming, so instead of envisioning multiple options, I am describing a concrete path you can follow to become a test automation engineer in 2022.

##Your background
Usually, there are three kinds of people who would like to become test automation engineers:
- People coming from a different field
- Manual testers
- Backend/frontend developers

Let's examine them one by one.

### Coming from a different field
There are many people nowadays who either got fed up with their current job or they see better (financial) opportunities in the field of testing or software development.

In case you are from this group you have to learn both testing and software development fundamentals before you can become a test automation engineer.

You have two options here:
- Learning software development first then testing
- Learning testing first then software development

I advise you to start with software development fundamentals for the following reasons:
- You can quickly realize whether programming is for you or not
- After you learn the basics you can still decide to specialize in test automation, frontend, or backend development depending on your interests.

In case you would like to




### Manual tester
This is the most usual pass. As a manual tester, it seems straightforward to transition to a test automation engineer. Less repetitive tasks, more respect, and more salary are the incentives usually.

As Dennis explains sooner or later you have to write your own code if you are a test automation engineer, so learning programming is inevitable.

Dear manual testers! I have bad news for you:

Programming is not for everyone. Being a programmer requires very analytic thinking and even if you have it, it does not worth anything if you do not enjoy coding.

You might get along 1-2 years in exchange for a higher salary, but sooner or later you will hate that job if you do not have a real internal motivation to do it.

Dear manual testers! I have good news for you:

Programming might be for you. You will never know if you like it or not if you do not try it.

### Software developer
