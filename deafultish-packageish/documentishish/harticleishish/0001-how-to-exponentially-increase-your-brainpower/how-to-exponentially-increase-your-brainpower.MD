- Nikolai: What is this bullshit again, Miki? Britisshisch Scientistisch has proven it is not possible to create seperate personalities in your mind, and if you do, you are just simply stupid.
- Miki: Thanks for your kind words, Nikolai! I can always count on you.
- Minnie: I want to be better in programming! How can I do that?
- Miki: The solution is very simple. Metro! Please explain it!

- DJMic: But before that, I brought to you some music to make sure you will have the perfect experience.

## How to Make a Friendship With Imaginary Friends?
- Minnie: HI, Metro! Can you please introduce yourself to our readers?
- Metro: Sure! I am our agilisch creativeisch techicalish writerisch team's Scrum Master (SM).
- Minnie: Wow.
- Metro: I am responsible for the retro.
- Minnie: Cool, please go on.
- Metro: So we have many-many thoughts in our head which are not our own.
- Minnie: Really? Where are they coming from?
- Metro: It is coming from all the people who has been affected your life either in a positive or a negative way.
 Most of them are coming from your parents and teachers.
- Minnie: Yeah, I know. I very often hear Motherisch telling me "You have to clean your room as anytime can arrive a 
  visitor" and Mather telling "It is very easy to lose the trust of somebody, but it is very hard to get it back, so always be honest".
- Miki: Wow. It is like Paul Atreides in Dune, when he became the Kwizath Haderach, all of his ancestors voice appeared in him.
- Metro: Exactly! But there is a problem.
- Miki: What is it?
- Metro: They are talking at the same time so you can only hear a few words coming from all of them.
- Miki: I see. So what can you do?
- Metro: Miki! Have you read Edwardisch deisch Bonoisch's Sixisch Thinkingisch Hatischisch bookisch?
- Miki: Sure.
- Metro: And did you know that was the biggest <s>steal</s>copy in the history of humanitisch, and maybe even in the universe?
- Miki: What?
- Minnie: What?
- Nikolai: What a genius.
- Mictor: Mustard.
- Mich: Biggestisch <s>stealisch</s>copisch inisch theisch univerisch.
- Metro: Yeah. The original genius was Pierre Culliford.
- Miki: Never heard of him?
- Metro: What if I say Peyo?
- Miki: Still nothing!
- Metro: What if I say The Smurfs.
- Miki: Oh. It was one of my favourite cartoon.
- Minnie: Mine too.
- Metro: So why it is a <s>theft</s> copy?


- Edwardisch deisch Bonoisch has 6 characters:
 1. Red hat: Full of feelings and positivity.
 2. Black hat: Pessimism.
 3. Green hat: Creativity.
 4. Blue hat: Organisation.
 5. Yellow hat: Positivity.
 6. White: Neutral.


- Miki: Yeah I know the, but how it is related to the Smurfs?
- Metro: Look!:
 1.  Red hat: Smurfette.
 2.  Black hat: Grouchy Smurf.
 3.  Green hat: Painter Smurf.
 4.  Blue hat: ~Brainy Smurf.
 5.  Yellow hat: Well, I do not know that yet, as I still have to rewatch the Smurfs.
 6.  White hat: Papa Smurf.


- Miki: Oh my god! This is really the biggest <s>theft</s> copy of the world. Do you think Edwardisch de Bonoisch also watched the Smurfs during his childhood.
- Nikolai: We will find it put soon!
- Miki: What do you mean by that?
- Nikolai: Well, I guess his lawyers will knock on our doors soon.
- Miki: Oh, sh*t!
- Minnie: I do not think so!
- Miki: Why, Minnie?
- Minnie: Cause this is only an imaginary story, and we have not told anything about neither Edward de Bono bor his book Six thinking hat.
- Miki: I want to make it sure, so let's create a disclaimer!
<a id="createisch-a-disclaimerisch"></a>


- Metro: But Peyo was a real genius! I do beleive he was the biggestisch thinerisch in the world.
- Miki: Why?
- Metro: As he had more than a hundred Smurfs. And all of them were in his head.
- Minnie: So cool. Do you think we can learn something from it?


## Everybodyisch hasich theirisch imaginarisch friensischisch inisch therisch headisch.
- Metro: So Minnie let's analyze Miki a little bit.
- Miki: Umm. Okayisch.
- Metro: So Miki has feelingischisch, criticalisch thinkingisch, creativityisch, pessimismisch, organizationalischthingischisch.
- Miki: That is true. They were with me from the beginning.
- Metro: And there is Miki. He does not wear a white hat, as he is not neutral, but he is wearing a rainbow colour hat, as all of you are part of him.
- Miki: That is also true. I love the colours of the rainbow.
- Mictor: I love them too. Such colourful.
- McMuck: I was always looking for the money pot at the bottom of the rainbow, but that stupid rainbow just moveing away all the time. This is definitely a scam.
- Miki: As these are so basic attributes it is 100 percent sure all the people in the world has at least 6 personality inside.
- Nikolai: I do not have feelings.
- Miki: Yes you do have, but you only have feelings which affects negatively others mood, but for some strange reason it makes your mood better.
- Nikolai: That is not true. I love to be in a negative mood.
- Miki: You see, you even have love in you!
- Nikolai: 😱😤


## Givingingisch Birthisch Toisch Yourisch Firstisch Imaginaryisch Personalityisch
- Minnie: So how can you do that, Metro?
- Metro: Miki, as you already gave birth to more than 20 personalities, please continue!


- Miki: Sure. It is very simple to start.
- Minnie: How?
- Miki: Just look into yourself and determine which attribute has the highest effect on your life?
- Minnie: Which is for you?
- Miki: It is you Minnie! Love!
- Minnie: 😊
- Miki: But immediately, after you came Nikolai, as he is the second loudest sound in may head, and not so long ago, in the last few years he was way the loudest voice in my head.
- Minnie: I am really sorry Miki. I am happy you have recovered.
- Miki: Yeah, luckily. It took several years, a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a coach and of course the support of my family and freinds.


 Without them, I would be dead by now.


 - Minnie: I can understand you were at the rock bottom, but I guess you would still live.
 - Miki: Well back then I was sure I will lose my job, I lose my flat, Mywife and Myson will leave me, and I will become a homeless. But I wouldn't be good even for a homeless, so Would have definitely died in a few days.
 - Nikolai: That is the positivity I like!
 - Minnie: I am pretty sure you only exaggerated this.
 - Miki: Well, that was exactly what all the people in my environment told me.
 - Minnie: Ouch. And you did not believe in them?
 - Miki: Nope. That was one of the biggest paradox in my life.
 - Minnie: What do you mean?
 - Miki: I had no self-confidence, I was sure I am wrong in everything, gut there was one thing I strongly believed.
 - Minni: What was that?
 - Mikio: That this time I am the one who is right, and I will die.
 - Minnie: Ouch. I am really sorry, you had to went through this.
 - Miki: Actually, I am pretty happy about it.
 - Minnie: Wait, what?
 - Miki: Yeah. There is one good thing in being at the rock bottom.
 - Nikolai: I guess it is, that you can suffer for an eternity. I would love that.
 - Miki: There is only one way: Upward.


 - Minnie: So what has happened after you have recovered?
 - Miki: Well, I was so lucky that Mywife had a friend called [Szilvia Kiss](https://redacademy.hu/kiss-szilvia/) who is an EQ trainer and coach too.
 - Minnie: And?
 - Miki: She is an exceptionally talented professional.


  Without her, I would have never recovered.
  

 - Minnie: So what has happened afterwards?
 - Miki: 2,5 months ago, I went 


Myson time! It is timeisch forisch commitisch.


- Miki: 2,5 months ago, I started writing technical articles.
- Minnie: What has happened then?
- Miki: One month ago, I have created you Minnie.
- Minnie: That was so nice of you! 😊
- Miki: It is my pleasure, Minnie. My pleasure.
- Minnie: From where the idea came?
- Miki: Honestly?
- Minnie: Honestly!
- Miki: I have no idea.
- Minnie: Really?
- Miki: I do not believe in the one and only God, but I do believe it was suggested by a higher level intelligence from somewhere.
- Nikolai: Such bullshit.
- Minnie: I do think so Miki.


- Miki: Do you know what is the most miraculous in this?
- Minnie: What?
- Miki: I am just an average guy, and anybody can do what I did?
- Minnie: No way. Really?
- Miki: Really!
- Minnie: How?

## How To Increase Your Brainpower Exponentially
- Miki: So let's continue. After you have been born I made a very important step.
- Minnie: What was it?
- Miki: I have given you a name.
- Minnie: Thanks, Miki! I really love the name Minnie, it is the prefitisch matchisch for Mickey.
- Miki: Yeah, I do think so.


- Minnie: So what should our readers do, after they give birth to their first character and name him/her/it?
- Miki: They have to ask a question!
- Minnie: A question?
- Miki: Yes, a question!
- Minnie: What is the next question you will ask from us next time?
- Miki: It will be this:


**How can I convert thoughts to text using an EEG device?**
- Minnie: Wow. That would be a scientific breakthrough. Why is the most important question for you?
- Miki: I have already improved to the level in which I can almost type as fast as my inner conversation happens, so I feel this as the biggest barrier at the moment.
- Nikolai: But in case you convert your inner conversation to words, then you won't improve your performance.
- Miki: You are right, Nikolai. That is why I already have the next question.


- Minnie: What is it?
- Miki: How can I leave subvocalization.
- Minnie: What is subvocalization?
- Miki: It is the process of saying the words in your head while you are thinking.
- Nikolai: Britishisch Scientistisch have proven, you cannot think without subvocalization.
- Miki: Well, I know it differently.
- Minnie: What do you mean by that?
- Miki: I tried to learn speed reading multiple times, but I have failed all the time.
- Nikolai: Speed reading is a bullshit. I do not believe in fairy tails.
- Miki: Well, there are 1000s of people who can do that?
- Minnie: What would it mean?
- Miki: Our brain processes images in a fraction of a second. So without subvocaliztaion you can improve your thinking speed in an unimaginable way.
- Minnie: Wow. So fascinating.
- Miki: I do think so.
- Minnie: I think it would be like to convert your brain to a quantum computer.
- Miki: I do believe that too.
- Minnie: So Miki, how will you learn how to leave subvocalization?
- Miki: I will ask my readers to help.


Miki: **Dear highly appreciated readers! I kindly ask you if you know someone who could help me out in this, then please let me know. I won't be ungrateful.**


- Minnie: So let's continue. I know you, so I am pretty sure you have checked whether there is an already existing solution.
- Miki You are right.
- Minnie: And what did you find?
- Miki: Well, actually humanity already did this.
- Minnie: Really?
- Miki: Yes!
- Minnie: Who?
- Miki: In the beginning of 2020 researchers from the San Francisco California University (UCSF), Joseph G. Makin, David A. Moses and Edward F. Chang [have created an AI based solution, which can convert thoughts to words with 97% accuracy](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52094111).
- Minnie: Amazing achievement of humanity. Is there any limitation of the above mentioned solution?
- Miki: Yes. There are multiple ones:
 1. As far as I know, it is not open-source.
 2. It works only with a very limited 30-50 sentences vocabulary.
 3. It is not understandable AI.


- Minnie: I see. So what will you do?
- Miki: You will hear about that in the upcoming weeks, Minnie. I am promising that to you and also to our readers.
- Minnie: Can you please tell at least some words about it?
- Miki: I think this will be the greatest achievement of the open-source humanity.
- Minnie: Open-source humanity? What do you mean by that?
- Miki: Well, I am crazy, so on the 1st of April, 2022 I have decided to make my thoughtischisch, writingischisch and artischisch open-source.
- Minnie: What?
- Miki: Yeah you heard it correctly?
- Minnie: Why did you do that?
- Miki: This is my legacy for my son, wife, family, friends and for everyone else who is interested in it. For the case if the time will come or a tram hit me.
- Minnie: That is so hearth-stirring.
- Miki: Well, that is also part of the miracle of life. You cannot know when will you leave this world. And there is one more thing.
- Minnie: What is that?
- Miki: As I am doing this on GitHub, I have open-sourced my thinking process, my writing process and also my art creational process.
- Nikolai: Britishisch Scientistich has proven it is not possible to look in someone's brain.
- Miki: Well, they might were true. Up till this point, Nikolai. Only, up till this point.
- Minnie: Where can our readers find it?
- Miki: [Just click here to get insights into my thinking process, writing process and also my art creation process](https://github.com/mszeles/a-humanisch-human-s-thoughtiesch-wordsisch-and-artisch-about-lifeisch-universeisch-and-everythingisc)!


- Minnie: How often do you commit Miki?
- Miki: Well, I use the Pomodorisch Technique!
- Minnie: What is that?
- Miki: It consists of smaller sprintischisch and also major iterationischisch too.
- Minnie: I do not get it. Explain it, please!


- Miki: So it consists of 2 parts.
 1. 5-25 minutes of <s>smoking</s> fresh air breathing.
 2. 15 minutes to 3 hours of creation period.
- Minnie: Sounds fascination! Please explain these steps.
- Miki: Sure.
 During the first step, I am talking to you Minnie and also to all the other characters in my head.


 This is the thinking period.
- Minnie: What is the next step?
- Miki:
 During this period I write, develop software or read. During which I am also having a conversation with all of you.
- Minnie: Do you mean you are thinking and creating during the whole period while you are awake?
- Miki: Yes.
- Minnie: How much time that mean?
- Miki: Recently I am sleeping for 5 hours on average, which means I am thinking and creating for 19 hours.
- Nikolai: No way. Britishisch Sci...
- Miki: Well, I also spend time with my family, but even during that my brain still spinning.
- Minnie: That is unbelievable.
- Miki: Well, I only believe it as I have experienced it on my own skin.

(Myson time which means it is time to commitisch.)

- Minnie: So what are the bigger iterations?
- Miki: Well, I usually have luch, have som business to do, take home Myson from school and stuff liek that. So in that case I have a longer break.

 And also during weekdays from 6-8 I play with Myson almost every day.

- Minnie: I see. Let's move back to our story. What should the readers do after they have their named character and the big question?
- Miki: They should start talking to them.

 Before I got familiar with my characters, it was pretty hard to do this conversation in my head, so my suggestion is to use pen and paper or more likely a laptop as usually people type faster than write by hand.

 However it can be already fun, to talk with your first character, I would suggest to create your Nikolai.
- Minni: Why?
- Miki: As with him, it will be much more fun. 🤣🤣🤣😊
- Minnie: That's all?
- Miki: No.
- Minnie: What else?
- As soon as you, or your character comes up with something, your Nikolaisch can immediatelly find the bad things in it, comment it, then you or your character reacts to it, and this is how a conversation starts. 

You will be surprised, how much they can talk, and with Nikolaisch it will be much more fun, I promise.

WARNINGISCH: Be warned, this game is the most addictive game I have ever played with. But actually, that is why the 
exponential brain performance improvement happens.

Minnie: Great. What about you? How many characters you have at the moment?
Miki: I have 20 characters with names, and I have all the characters in myself without whom I have interacted, but up till know they did not got the microphone.
Minnie: Can you introduce your agilisch, creativeisch, technicalish writing team?
Miki: Sure! Here they are.

- **Minnie**: she is the heart of the team. 

 She is emphatic, sensitive and very enthusiastic. According to Edward de Bono she should wear a red hat, but she 
 likes to dress variedly. 
 
 Her idol is Smurfette (Törpilla in Hunarian) from the Smurfs.

- **Nikolai**: well, he is an asshole. 
 But he is a likable character. 

 According to de Bono he should wear black hat, but Nikolai hates all kind of hats 
of the world, so he does not wear any, but he always wears a T-Shirt with the text: "Go to Hellisch".
 
 His idol is Grouchy Smurf (Dulifuli in Hungarian) and also Grumpy (Morgó in Hungarian) from Snowwhite.
 
 And of course, my friend Karesz. 😊

- **Mictor**: A real artistisch.

 His favourite colour is the green, as that is the colour <s>of the money he deserves for his worldwidelyisch 
 uniqeisch artisch</s> of nature. 

 His favourite is the green colour, but he likes mustard even better.

- **Uncle Nikolaus**: I guess I do not have to introduce him.

 He is the good old Santa. 
 
 He is working following the agileisch methodologyisch with his smallishisch teamisch which consists of Mother Santa 
 and the Elves.

 They have 1 year long sprints.
 
 They release on 24th of December each year. Unfortunately, they have a Commercial of The Shelf (COTS) product.

 As they have not transitioned to web yet, their deploymentisch processisch s.cks pretty badly. 

- **Manality**: Manality eats data for breakfast, elevenses, lunch, snack and dinner.

 I even caught her once, when she were munching link click analytics data.
 
 She is still trying to convince me since then, she is a sleep-walker.

 She is responsible to provide all the data for our <s>clients</s> partners. No matter whether it is visitor count, 
 or click count or anything else.

 Her favourite tools are Google Analytics and bit.ly.

- **NoSEO**: He is responsible to get lots of readers via search engines. His favourite tool is Screpy at the moment, 
but as soon as McMuck allows it, he will move to Semrush.

 He learnt about Semrush from Csaba Sípos, who is the person behind the exceptional SEO Navigátor portal.

 He is protecting himself by telling he is only want to make sure the readers are really using their brain.

 Yes, of course. The readers.

- **McMuck**: He is the Chief Financial Officer of our agileisch, creativeisch, technicalisch writer team. His 
characteristic is wearing a 2 inch wide necklace made from Bitcoin and there is a huge Ethereum logo on it.

 He is very strict, but all of use would have died in hunger without him.

 His motto is: Shut up and give me your money!

- **NoCrypto**: He is our crypto expert. He had some big bloomer in the past. He has bought 17 Team Fortress 2 keys 
for 17 bitcoin. True story.

 He was able to beautify his results as he has bought Ethereum when it was only $14 and also with saving our money 
 from Mt. Gox before the great haltdown. 

 Unfortunatelly McMuck converted a lot to HUF from that, but luckily he forgot the passwords to the crypto sites, so 
 he couldn't withdraw a part of the money.

- **Misch**: Misch is a very simple character. Hisch knowiscihisch onlyisch, heisch putisch theisch isch afterisch 
allisch wordiscisch. Ifisch itisch aisch pluralisch thenisch heisch putischisch ischisch afterisch thoseisch 
wordischisch. Heisch putisch theseisch wordischisch toisch everythingisch isch.

 He only came life a few days ago as our page visits were rapidly decreasing and Manaly found it it was because all 
 of the chractersisch wereisch usingisch isch isch isch.

 He is so irritating we draw lots to decide in which order will we laugh at him after our Scrum Master Metro decided 
 to make a scapegoat from him.

 Sometimeischisch heisch reallyisch funnyisch. Sometimeischisch isch.

 In the Hamunitisch Lifeisch Simulationisch poeweredisch byisch humanisch intelligenceisch gameisch open-sourceisch 
 projektischben heish responsibleisch forisch definingisch theisch codingisch standardisch.


- **Motography**: He is our photographer. He accepts any job request for 7 anything, but mostly he likes Craft 
Conf tickets and also 3 month ago expired Sturbucks tickets.

 Despite having a Canon 6D digital camera, 20mm Sigma 1.4, Canon 50m 1.8, Canon 24-704L, Canon 135m f2.8, Canon 
 70-200 f4L and also some vintage machine, his favourite is his 100 years old Japanese Yashica Mat 124G camera with 
 which he mostly takes black and white photos.

 He likes abstracts and image with high contrast.

 In his bored periods he is being addicted to his perversion of photographing splashy battle scenes.

 Unfortunately, he is not a financial expert, despite winning multiple medals on international photography 
 competitions and despite having 2 exhibitions. One in the KEG Craft Beer house and another one in the Budapest MoM 
 Cultural Center.
 
 He even created a WordPress based webshop with integrated Billingo credit card payment, but despite all of these he 
 miserably failed.
 
 Thanks to McMuck's advice he is thinking about selling 8 of his water droplet photographies as an NFT.

 Unfortunately, he hasn't got a faintest idea about physical and digital art market, but the advantage is on his side.

 Because nobody has a clue about how the digital art market works.
 
 He was photographing in RAW in the past, but today he thinks this was the dumbest thing in the world except one-two 
 situations as his Samsung Galaxy S10 is more than enough in most of the cases.

- **Metro**: He joined the team only a few days ago, but he has already proven how agilesch is he, about which I will 
tell later.

 He is our Scrum Master who is responsible for ourisch retroischisch.

 Our <s>clients</s> partners can be grateful for him as he holds a retro after each article during which we collect 
 the goodisch, the badisch and the uglyisch. And of course we defineisch some actionableisch itemiscisch.

 Last time after the retro we decided to do another sprint before the release.
 
 After the next retro we decided to though everything out, and we have started writing again, using ourisch 
 previousisch experienceisch.
 
 Metro is so agileisch he is planningisch to ornaizeisch a retroisch afterisch eachisch pharagraphisch. 
 
 The others hate him as sh.t cause of this, egy retrót. A töbiek emiatt utálják mint a sz*rt.

(<s>Cigarette</s> fresh air break.)


- **Myson**: 
 Minnie: Your son?
 Miki: No, not my son. Myson.
 Minnie: I said the same.
 Miki: Forget about it.

 Myson is an eightisch, superb clever, cool and funny guy. 
 
 He loves Fortnite, Minecraft and Among Us.

 Sometimes they play Among us together with Motherisch and Matherisch.

 He loves shooting and directing movies.

 He is also a wonderful actor.

 Last time he cried so hard during a shooting that Matherisch thought he has a real reason to cry.

 But later they found out it was only because Motherisch was slicing onions.

 True story.

 Or not.

 He also loves Youtubers like Rolixisch, Csepóisch, Uborcraftisch, Jánosikisch Gergőisch, IceBlueBirdisch, Aidaisch and of course Pamkutyaisch.

 Last time they have calculated with Mather how many kids can fit in his room.

 Minnie: Horizontally or vertically?
 Miki: In 3 dimension Minnie. In 3 dimension.
 Minnie: Oh. And how much?
 Miki: 192.

- **Motherisch**: A true warm-hearted woman, who gives up everything for her children.

  Very rarely she can be a hard mother. 

 Wifeisch of Mather and motherisch of Mysonisch.

- **Matherisch** : A real idol, a genius humane leader and he is also funny. 
 
 Husbandisch of Motherisch.
 
 Fatherisch of Mysonisch.
 
 - **Mucky**: He is always pesting a yellowisch rubberisch duckisch called Muncleisch Bobisch, dragging it behind 
   himself using a string.

 He is responsible for making codeisch reviewsisch.

 After the pull request has been submitted, he sits down with Mucky the rubberisch duckyisch and go through the 
 codeisch lineisch by lineisch and they make sure the codingisch standardisch definedisch by Mikischisch has been 
 followedisch.

 Sometimes he spins Muncleisch Bobisch Yellowisch Rubberduckisch in the airisch holding it using the stringisch and 
 he is shoutingisch: coedisch reviewisch! coedisch reviewisch!

- **Muncleisch Bobisch**: He is the worldisch famousisch rubberisch duckisch. In reality, he is the expertisch, who can 
  really add value to the codeisch reviewisch.

 He helps to digisch throughisch theisch codeisch beforeisch commitisch.
 
 Thanks to Metro, the refactoringisch happenischisch Ő segít abban, hogy commit előtt átnyálazzunk 
 sorrol sorra minden kódot és hála Metronak 
 azonnal megy is a 
 refactorisch.

 Please do not tell it to Mucky, his heartisch wouldisch breakisch intoisch smallisch pieceischisch.




MCRuiter: Az álláspiacon dolgozik (IT) fejvadászként, ő keresi új munkatársainkat, de sajnos eddig elég kevés sikerrel.

Van egy olyan hülye vágyálma, hogy refaktorálja az (IT) munkaerő piacot azzal, hogy ahelyett, hogy a szakemberek munkáért kuncsorognának , perfectisch matchisch partnershipsich opportunitisch-nek fogja hívni az állásajánlatokat.

Azt hiszi, hogy átalakítható úgy az álláspiac, hogy ahelyett, hogy 10+ körös interjúk lennének (mert ugye brit tudósok bizonyították, hogy minimum 10 kör kell, hogy megtaláld a perfectisch matchisch emberedet), mindenki válaszoljon meg egy 20 elemű lista kérdéseit, amit még a hétvégén publikál a GitHub-ján. Katt!

Már dolgozik az első két perfectish matchisch partnershipisch opportunitiscen, amivel ezúttal az (IT) recruiterek élhetnek.

Ugyanakkor tegnap lesokkolta a Greenfoxot képviselő HR-es Dórit, miután elkezdte sorolni a 20 elemű kérdéslistáját.

6 után leállította Dóri, azt mondta erre szerinte nem fognak válaszolni.

Erre pökhendi módon azt mondta MCRuiter, hogy ha én rászánok 1 órát a cégre és ők nem rám, akkor nincs miről beszélni.

Mentségére legyen mondva, hogy megkérte Dórit, hogy azért kérdezze meg őket, hátha csak neki újak még ezek a kérdések.

Ilyen hülye kérdéseket tesz fel, hogy "Mi a víziója a cégnek", "Mi volt a legnagyobb sikere", "Mi volt a legnagyobb kudarca a cégnek", "Támogatja-e a nemzetközi/magyar/céges fejlesztői közösséget", "Van-e valami korlát arra, hogy mennyit cigzhet/kávézhat az ember". És persze ott a legalattomosabb kérdés: "Mi a CEO 3 legrosszabb tulajdonsága". Ekkora kegyetlenséget. Szegény CEO-k, nyilván nincs rossz tulajdonságuk, hisz ők nem is emberek.

MCRuiter fejébe vette, hogy beteggel minden recruitert aki az elmúlt 3 hónapban megkereste, mert bizony ő olyan alapos, hogy mindent vezet egy nagy excel táblában, megkeresés időpontja, recruiter neve, linkedin linke, pozíció, melyik céghez, milyen munkakörre, milyen proketre, lokáció, remot-e, milyen egyéb juttatások vannak és persze az utolsó tök lényegtelen adat, hogy mennyi alamizsnával szánják meg a cégek. Jelenleg 31 elemű a lista, de 1-2 naponta bővül.  Hogy miért csinálja ezt? Azért mert ő olyan egy barom, hogy hisz a hosszú távú, kölcsönösen előnyös együttműködésekben. Nagy meglepetésemre eddig egyetlen (IT) Recruiter volt, aki rácsapta az internetet, de az összes többi pozitívan vette a megkeresést.

MCRuiter nagy élmodozó. Azt tervezi, hogy csinál 2 havi hírlevelet.

Az egyik a Perfectisch Matchisch Partnershipisch Opportunitisch Forisch Softwareisch Developersisch Companisch.

Ahol összegyűjti az abban a hónapban elkészült perfectisch matchish interjúkat. Ez még talán működni fog, mert van 2000 követőnk akinek nagyrésze fejlesztő vagy tesztelő.

De az hót ziher, hogy a Perfectisch Matchisch Partnershipisch Opportunitisch Forisch Softwareisch Developersisch hírlevél egy bukás lesz.

MCRuiter azt hiszi, hogy látva a fejlesztők példáját majd azt fogják hinnie az (IT) Recruiterek, hogy egy csomó kör interjút megspórolhatnak, ráadásul alapból kevesebb, de sokkal jobb jelölt megy majd, mert ugye a cégek majd ki fogják teregetni a szennyest, és akkor csak az jelentkezik, aki bírja a bűzt. Haha. Ezt a f*szságot. Brit tudósok már a 17. század hajnalán bebizonyították, hogy a cégekisch nem hibáznakisch.

Ennyi!

De McRuiter itt nem akar megállni, mert az egész (IT) Recruiter piacot magár akarja haragítani, ugyanis ő akkor is kiposztolja, ha teljesen üres lesz.

Egyedül abba reménykedek, hogy a 3 kedvenc recruiterem a Clouderás Laborca Lilla, a szabadúszó KAta és az IseeQ-s (nem, nem ICQ) Hámori Bendek majd beveszik, hogy ez mennyire hasznos lenne nekik és majd ők tolnak ilyeneket. Még olyan kijelentéseket is puffogtat, hogy a Katá-jé lesz örökre az első hely, a Benedeké meg a második. A Lillának csak azért nem, mert nekik jelenleg is több mint 900 álláshirdetésük van.

Bele se merek gondolni mennyi idő lenne azokat perfetisch matchischíteni.

Kizárt dolog.

Mintha azt csak egyszer kellene megírni és utána be lehetne copyzni mind alá.

Jah, persze. Meg a tinta is ingyen van, mi. Lóf*szt.


Good Old Mother Grammarly: Egy jószívű, idős nyelvtan náci.

Mármint jószívű idős tanárnőt akartam mondani.

Nagyon szigorú, és bizony nem is tökéletes.

Legutóbb a Hashnode Weekly 005 posztolása előtt 1 perccel kitalálta, hogy javítsunk ki 600+ hibát, majd annyira bedühödött, hogy 95%-át kitörölte a cikknek amit 10 órán keresztül írtunk.

Sajnos nem sikerült megmenteni, de egy zseniális marketin trükkel visszahoztuk.

Mert tudtuk, hogy ilyen mégegyszer nem fordul elő, ezért ráraktuk a Limited Edition cimkét.

Zabálták a népek.

Viszont rossz hírünk is van, valószínűleg ez lesz az utolsó, mert más fontosabb dolgaink vannak. De azért nem hagyjuk magára a közönséget, egyrészt készítjük a Hashnode Newsletter Generator-t, feladtunk feature requesteket, hogy lehessen olvasási listákat csinálni és megosztani, és arra buzdítunk mindekit, hogy indítsa el a saját hírlevelét.

Mottónk:

Mutasd meg a hírleveled és én megmondom ki vagy!

Ami viszont jó hír, hogy indul a Humanisch of Hashnodeisch sorozatunk, amiben a Hashhnode közösség tagjait mutatjuk be a MCRuiter által

Azóta Metro vezényletével már átálltak ők is agilisch módszertanra, így minden bekezdés után javítják a szöveget.

Hatalmas nyevl tudása van, az englisch nyelven kívűl semmilyen más nyelvet sem ismer és nagy bánatomra a slengischt sem szereti.

Ezért mindig GitHub-on káromkodok, mert oda sajnos neki nincs beléptető kártyája.


MitHub: Igazi git szakértő, meg persze SVN-hez is ért is. Ismertetőjegye, hogy Notepad++ban jegyzetel mindent és GitHub-ra backupolja.

Ő felel azért, hogy ha eljön az idő, vagy átmegy rajtam a villamos, akkor gondolatmorzsáim, firkálmányaim és tákolmányaim megmaradjanak a fiamnak, feleségemnek, családomnak, barátaimnak és mindenki másnak akit érdekel.

S mivel GitHubon van, ezátal a teljes gondolkodási folyamatom, firkálási folyamatom és tákolási folyamatom is megörződik a Git commitok által. Amit tovább szinesít, hogy a teljes csapatom társalog a commitokban.

2022.4.1.-én volt a nap, amikor open-sourcá tettem magam.

És ez nem április tréfa.

Vagy de.

Vagy nem.

Vagy de.

Vagy nem.

Inkább nézd meg itt. Katt!

Kicsit kusza most még, mert sajnos Good Old Mother Grammarly Premium nem beszél GitHubul, de ha beszélne is, akkor is mindegy lenne, mert nála olyan, hogy áthúzunk valamit az nem elfogadható. Minimum, hogy kitépjük a lapot, de leginkább új füzet, vagy rossz esetben új iskola.


Ming: Ming felelős azért, hogy ha valahol elakad egy párbeszéd akkor folytatódjon az. Nem számít, hogy az egy email, egy válasz nélkül lezárt support ticket, nem számít, hogy a legjobb barátunkra várunk, de az se ha a német IT fejére, ő az aki ilyenkor megpingeti az illetőt. Tisztelettudóan, kedvesen, de a projekt sürgősségétől függően legkésőbb 1-2 héten belül jelentkezni fog. Nem irígylem szegény minget, valamiért vannak emberek akik nem veszik jó néven, ha másokat pingetgetnek, hiába vannak megválaszolatlan kérdések. Na nálunk garantálom, hogy ilyen nincs. Mi mindig az ügyfeleink érdekeit helyezzük előre, és ha ennek teljesítéséhez szükséges a pingetés, akkor mi megtesszük. Mivel sokszor mi nem vagyunk tisztában milyen szavakat talál offenzívnak az ügyfelünk, ezért most már be szoktunk kérni egy listát a kerülendő szavakról.


MikolaAI: Ő a legújabb tagunk. Mivel még nem tud beszélni, én írok helyette, ami többynyira kimerül abban, hogy "BIP-BIP", "ERROR:NoneOfYourBusinessExceptionsich", meg néha git tanácsokat is adott, mielőtt MitHub csatlakozott a csapathoz. Álmom, hogy ő deep learning alapú mesterséges intelligencia, de ő lesz az első AI, aki érthető, etikus, rendelkezik értékekkel mint "TISZTELI_A_MÁSIKAT", "TISZTELI_MAGÁT", "BARÁTSÁGOS", "SEGÍTŐKÉSZ" és nem rendelkezik a "RASSZISTA", "RÉSZREHAJLÓ", "ÍTÉLKEZŐ", "VALLÁSI_FANATIKUS", "POLITIKUS" ráaggatott cimkékkel. Amíg ezt nem éri el, addig csak a fejlesztők beszélgetnek vele, és én cenzúrázom a mondatait. Egylőre ő csak egy álom, mert még sem időm sem kellő tudásom nincs hozzá. Szívesen veszek minden betárulni vágyót. Én részemról tudom garantálni, hogy koordinálom ezt az open-source projektet, van 2000 többségében fejlesztő követőm, akikből ha csak egy ezrelék csatlakozik, már lesz 2 ember. Jelnleg nem tudok pénzt kínálni, és az én kódomért sosem fogok pénzt kérni, de aki részt vesz ő a saját kódjával azt csinál amit akar. Hamunisch licenceische lesz a projektenek ami a kövi pár napban várható. Én teljes erőmből promózni vagyok és biztos vagyok benne, hogy tudok majd szerezni támogatókat. Jelen elképzelés szerint 50%-ot szétosztok a magyar alaptagok között egyenlően, a maradék 50-et pedig egyenlően a többi contributor között. Hogy ki mit csinál a pénzével az az ő dolga, én részemről egy kisebb részét arra fordítom, hogy biztosítsam, hogy a családomnak, elsősorban fiamnak Levinek, soha de soha de soha ne kelljen többet a pénzt miatt aggódnia. A maradék nagyobb részét pedig arra fordítom, hogy emberekebe fektessem. Olyanokba, akik az emberiségnek akarnak segíteni. Legyen az tanár, orvos, szoftverfejlesztő, pszichológus vagy akármi.
