Nikolai: What is this bul.shit again?
Miki: This is not bul.shit, this is one of the greatest conference about software development.
Nikolai: YAC!
Miki: What does YAC mean?
Nikolai: Yet another conference.
Miki: YAC!
Nikolai: My YAC?
Miki: My YAC!
Nikolai: What YAC?
Miki: This YAC.
Maudience: Guys! Stop it! We are losing our readers!
Nikolai: So what does your YAC mean?
Miki: Yes, another conference!
Nikolai: But this is your third conference in this year. Just recall the first conference about the Future of Testing framework. That was a huge disappointment.
Miki: You are right, we heard almost nothing about the future, but it was still very valuable. Anyway, do you remember Reinforce AI? That was a great conference.
Nikolai: Sure. I am waiting to give me life since you wrote [Would You Freak Out If You Could Talk To Dead People? - Miki Szeles's Report on Reinforce AI Conference.](https://mszeles.com/would-you-freak-out-if-you-could-talk-to-dead-people-miki-szeless-report-on-reinforce-ai-conference)
Miki: Who knows, maybe in the future when you will have enough digital footprint. I might resurrect you then.
Nikolai: I have to admit, it was a very eye-opening conference, even I enjoyed it, but how can you tell based on that Craft Conf will be a great conference?
- Miki: There were multiple successful Craft Confs during the last years.

  Nikolai: Who are they?
  Miki: They are the people behind CraftHub, the organizer of the Reinforce AI conference.

- Nikolai: Cool. Will you be at the conference personally then?
- Miki: Yep.
- Nikolai: Can I go?
- Miki: All of us will go, which means 40+ characters.
- McMuck: We will go bankrupt. Do we have to pay tickets for all of us?
- Miki: Easy, McMuck. Easy. We will be disguised.

- McMuck: Who?
- Miki: We will look like as Miki Szeles üòä
- McMuck: Huh. We are saved.
- Nikolai: Ok, so can we get back to the conference?
- Miki: Sure.
- Nikolai: So, we have decided we will go, I do believe it is time to make our schedule.
- Miki: You are right. How will we create our schedule?
- Manality: Don't worry, we will use a Google Spreadsheet based on which you and your readers can easily create their own schedule.
- Miki: Cool. Where is it?
- Manality: It does not exist yet.
- Miki: What?
- Manality: I will need 1-2 hours to do that.
- Maudience: But we will lose our readers by then.
- Mikaru: Do not worry. I brought here a great Japanese anime, I am pretty sure they will stick to the screen.
- Miki: Oh. I think I know what you will bring. You will bring the anime which inspired me to play go back then.
- Mikaru: Exactly. It is the Hikaru No Go anime. The whole series is available on Youtube. [Click here to watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjk_FN4ksoM&list=PLjfQRGRsHmsB8z8fdiBVS0NVadI3BwSGo).

- Minnie: Hi. Sorry for being late, I just had the data analysis class taught by experts from Dmlag at the Budapest University of Economics and Technology (BME).
- Miki: Cool. What have you learned?
- Minnie: I learned about time series, but to be honest I could not focus as Meadline pushed me to do my work as the deadline is very close.
- Maudience: Guys and Minnie! Focus. Focus. You know, our audience...
- Miki: We know, Maudience. We know.
- Minnie: So we can write the end of the article and as we will meet Anna today we can ask for a schedule from here.
- Miki: Cool. Then let's write the Giveaway section.

## The Craft Conf Giveaway
Dear fellow Hloggers!

I would like to inspire you for writing articles, so I have decided to have a giveaway in which you can win a ticket for the Craft Conf 2022.

I do not believe in luck, so I will personally select the winners.

There are 3 categories in which you can participate:
1. Funniest technical harticle
2. Most inspiring harticle
3. Any other harticle

The selection process will be sobjective, which means it will be subjective as there is no single person in the world who can be totally objective and it will be objective as my whole team will evaluate the harticles, which means 40+ different viewpoints.

Rules of participation:
1. You have to write a harticle, which means you have to write an article and publish it on Hashnode. Why Hashnode? Because I do believe this is the best platform for software developers. Both for finding and wrirting valuable articles. I highly recommend reading my

article till the 15th of May and you have to close the article title with "AKA Craft Conf Giveaway Participation".
2. You In case you will be selected as a winner, you have to write a 1000 words article about the conference.
