HI Fellow Human!

I am Miki Szeles from Hungary.

I am an average guy.

A single human just like you.

A single human with a twist.

I am an agileisch human.

In this description and in the video, I will not just tell you, but show you, how can you exponentially improve your memory each day of your life.

I show you the complete process I use including memory palaces and number memorization techniques.

I will show you how you can memorize anything in the world by showing you how you can even memorize such boring stuff as simple circles.

By watching the video you can learn how to become exponentially better in everything you are doing by doing one single thing:

Hiring your own agileisch Scrumisch Masterisch.

Mine is called Metro and he is responsible for the retro (retrospective) in which the whole team ( I have 20+ characters by now but they are rapidly increasing) participates.

For those who are not coming from the agile world, please let me explain it.

An agile retro has 3 parts.

Part 1: What went good?
In this part, the Scum Master collects the list of things team members liked during this sprint (iteration).

Part 2: What went bad?
Every team member tells what went wrong during the period about which we are doing a reflection.

Part 3: What should we do?
In this last part, the team defines actionable items with which the process can be further improved.

A single (this is very important) responsible person is assigned to each task.

All the tasks should have a deadline, or in case you are even more agile, then you can create Userisch Storyischisch from them, and prioritize them together with all the other items on your backlog.

The backlog is the single source of truthisch.

In the backlog all the relevant actionable items are present and they are ordered according to their importance.

When a new sprint/iteration comes, then the items from the top of the backlog are moved to the sprint.

The team focuses only on those items and it is the Scrum Master"s responsibility to beat of any obstacles the team is facing.

A sprint/iteration can be your whole life before this point, but it can be reading, writing some books or code, or learning something, or it can be as small as a paragraph.

This process is so simple, you do not need to read dozens of books and practice for months to learn it, but you can learn it by simply watching this video and then picking any topic in which you would like to improve.

I suggest starting with improving your memory as boosting your memory will boost your learning which will boost your whole life.

But this video is not for free!

You have to invest your own time.

You have to invest your own time to become a child in order to use this method.

Or at least you have to be an adultisch adult, like me.

But I have some good news for you:

There is a child in all of us!

Maybe it is buried deep in yourself, but luckily everybody still has the child in themselves whom they were several years ago.

There is only one trick needed to wake it up and I am telling it to you right now:

You have to give a name to it!

It does not matter how you call it.

It can be your name, your nickname from your childhood, or any name.

For me, this kid is not me anymore, but it is my son.

So my character is called Myson.

Why do you have to name it?

As because from the point you name it, you can engage in a conversation with him/her/it.

Up till you do not give a name to the loudest thoughts in your head, they will talk at the same time, so you will almost hear nothing.

This is how I lived 30+ years of my life.

I still do not know how it is started (I do believe there is a higher intelligence), but the moment came when I gave a name to the character/feeling/attribute/value which was the loudest in my head.

Not so long ago, it was Nikolia for years, but luckily by now, I am much more Minnie.

So at some point Minnie appeared in on of my technical articles, and she messed up everything.

She made my highly recognized technical writing become an even highly recognized technicalish writing.

In case you read my articles you can clearly follow the evolution of my writing.

In the beginning, it was only me.

Then my first few characters came which were inspired by Edward de Bono's six thinking hats:
- Minni: red hat.
- Nikolai: black hat.
- Mictor: green hat.
- Miki: white hat. In reality, it is a rainbow-coloured hat as I am a mixture of all of them.

A little bit later I have realized something which you won't believe.

Many of our kids already know how to use Edward de Bono's six thinking hats.

They know it, but they have a different name for it.

They call it 100 thinking Smurfs.

Peyo was a genius. He has created all the smurfs, which means more than a hundred smurfs. Each of them has its own unique feelings and characteristics.

My characters are hamunisch likeisch, they have multiple characters/feelings/attributes/values  in themselves, so basically they have the same complexity in them as I have in myself.


However you can already start with Minnie (Smurfette), I would suggest resurrecting your Nikolai (Grouchy Smurf).

Let me introduce it with an example.

Miki: So why should I resurrect Nikolai?
Minnie: Because despite being grumpy he is a lovely teddy bear.
Nikolai: I hate teddy bears. And not just teddy bears, but all bears in the world.
Minnie: Even the bear from Masha and the Bear?
Nikolai: I hate that bear the most.
Miki: Minnie, Nikolai! We are here to demostrate your added value to thos conversation.
Minnie: But we are doing that Miki, right now.
Nikolai: Britishisch scientistisch has proven long ago even before the Big Bang that you cannot add value to writing by transforming it to a conversational style, as it will become so dry as the Kalahari Desert.

And that is not enough. They have even proven that examining any topic from multiple viewpoints makes no sense, as you can get the best result if the whole team shouts his opinion at the same time. And in the end the accepted opinion will be the one who was the loudest.
Mictor: Such sarcasm. And mustard too. Definitely mustard. Much much more mustard.
Minnie: Well, Nikolai! You might be wrong in the first 2 points, but the third point might be right.
Miki: Was that also really proven by Britishisch Scientistischisch?
Minnie: No, it was proven by Lifeisch.



Let me give some analogies to what it feels like to be me at the moment.

It might sound exaggerated, but I do feel like being a superhero who just recently found his first superpower.

My first superpower is learning.

As I feel like a superhero, now I am looking for ways to use my superpower to help humanity, to help people make Earth a better place for our kids and also for ourselves too.

As we have already seen in The Avengers and also in X-men, a small group of superheroes can achieve greater things than a single superhero (except Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel can achieve anything on her own, but she is too busy to stay here on Earth).

but I am dreaming about becoming a superhero since my childhood and as  for me it is really feels like being a superhero.

It is like being Paul Atreides.

After Paul became Maudib



I could compare it to microprocessors.

By introducing my 20+ characters, I can think with 20+ threads on a single core each of them having their unique value.

Even Misch.
