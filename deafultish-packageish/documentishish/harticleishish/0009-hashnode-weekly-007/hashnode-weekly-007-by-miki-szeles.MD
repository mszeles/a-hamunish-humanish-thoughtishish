- Maudience: Hello, dear Readers! Hello, Miki!
- Miki: Hello, dear Readers! Hello, Maudience!
- Maudience: How many articles did you bookmark, Miki?
- Miki: 86.
- Maudience: Wow, you found 86 harticles worth mentioning in one week?
- Miki: Yes, and I have not even had the chance to check all of the titles.
- Nikolai: But, there are only around 40 articles here. How is that possible?
- Miki: I had very little time and in case I want to include all 86 articles then it would take me several hours more, to write the recommendation to all of them.
- Minnie: So, you decided to post more frequently!? Very clever.
- Miki: Well, I am not sure that I will post more frequently as I have much less time to read articles nowadays, but I am planning to post around 40 articles in each Hashnode Randomly.
- Minnie: Oh, so keep the name Hashnode Randomly!?
- Miki: Yes. Having the name weekly put too much pressure on me. I wanted to finish the article during the weekend, then I pushed myself to read again every title and I have no time for that now.
- Nikolai: I guess you were wasting your time on stupid things so you had no time to read all the titles.
- Miki: Well, I wouldn't call spending time with my family, my friends, reading, working, relaxing, and sleeping stupid.
- Nikolai: Umm. Okayish.

- Maudience: What can our readers expect from you in the upcoming weeks, Miki?
- Miki: My plan is to move back to test automation. I have started a series about the Selenide test automation framework which I would like to continue. I have also started a harticle about Karate DSL which would be great to finish, but before that, I am planning to post an article in which I give a complete path that can help people land their first job as a test automation engineer.
- Maudience: Sounds interesting. How can our readers make sure they won't miss your articles?
- Miki: At the top of each of my harticles (including this one) there is a subscribe to my newsletter section, so they can get all my articles in their inbox as soon as I post them.

- Maudience: Great. So once again. What about the Hashnode Randomly?
- Miki: I love reading Hashnode articles, it became my hobby. Again. There are so many great articles that get lost due to the tremendous amount of new articles appearing on Hashnode weekly. That is why I started the Hashnode weekly back then to draw attention to those hidden gems.
- Nikolai: But you are not objective Miki. Your article selection is highly biased by your own preference.
- Miki: That is true, and completely okay too.
- Nikolai: Why?
- Miki: First of all no matter who creates a newsletter, that will be biased. Secondly, I suppose there is some overlapping between my readers' preferences and my preferences all in all that is why they are reading my articles.
- Nikolai: That's all?
- Miki: No. As you know Nikolai I like to broaden my view, so I read 3 types of articles nowadays.
- Nikolai: What are they?
- Miki: Anything testing related. Unfortunately, there are only very few articles from this category here on Hashnode, but I do hope it will change in the future.
- Nikolai: What else?
- Miki: Anything which is highly related to my current interest which means articles about Python development, productivity, psychology, self-improvement, AI, and data analysis.
- Nikolai: What is the third?
- Miki: Interesting articles which are not closely related to my current knowledge. I have written about this in detail in [my article where I summarized the experiences of my first month as a hlogger.](https://mszeles.com/my-first-month-on-hashnode-a-retrospection-about-blogging-on-hashnode-developer-journaling-platform-by-miki-szeles)
- Maudience: Guys! Let's start with the harticles, I do not want to lose our readers right at the beginning.
