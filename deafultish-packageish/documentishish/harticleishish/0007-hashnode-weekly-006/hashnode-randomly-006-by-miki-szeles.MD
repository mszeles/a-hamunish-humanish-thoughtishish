## What has happened in the last 2 months?
- Minnie: Yuppie. I can't believe it. Another Hashnode Weekly. Finally.
- Miki: Yeah, I am also happy about that.
- Minnie: What happened? Why didn't you post for 2 months?
- Miki: You know, I read 80-100 articles weekly and I realized I could not focus on other things if I am reading so much. I also burnt out on reading a little bit, so luckily I stopped.
- Minnie: Luckily?
- Miki: Luckily.
- Minnie: Why?
- Miki: As I had time to be creative and focus on other topics too.
- Minnie: So what did you do in the last 2 months?

- Nikolai: 9 articles in 9 weeks? Such a loser. Earlier you posted daily.
- Miki: Well, you are partially right, but 4 of them are above 20 minutes read time and 2 of them above 30 minutes.
- Nikolai: You are crazy, nobody will read them.
- Miki: Well, I might be a little bit crazy, but I have employed Maudience to make sure we can keep (the attention of) our audience and make sure they can get the most out of our articles if they do not have 10+ minutes.
- Nikolai: Does that work?
- Miki: We will see. We will see, Nikolai!
- Nikolai: So that's all that you did in the last 2 months?
- Miki: Nope. I have worked in my full-time job as a test automation engineer, and also spent a lot of time with my son, Levi.
- Minnie: Yes, family time is very important. The most important one is from all the mentioned things. I will make sure you will never lose focus on that.
- Miki: Thanks, Minnie.
  <a id="rediscover-your-inner-superhero">
### Helping you to redicover your inner superhero
- Nikolai: I am still not impressed with what you did. Is there anything else?
- Miki: Yes. I have learned many many memorization, learning, and thinking methods during the last three decades of my life.
- Nikolai: I know. None of them stuck, you gave up using them after a short while.
- Miki: None of them worked up till recently as suddenly everything started to work.
- Nikolai: How is that possible?
- Miki: I have employed Metro.
- Nikolai: Who is he?
- Miki: He is our Scrum master responsible for retros.
- Nikolai: Ah, so he helps with your full-time job?
- Miki: No, he helps in almost everything that I am doing in my life?
- Nikolai: Whaaaaat?
- Miki: No matter what I am doing, I am doing it in short 15min-3 hours iterations. I do them up till the flow remains.
- Nikolai: How is that helpful?
- Miki: I have a retrospective after each session.
- Nikolai: A retro what?
- Miki: Retrospective comes from Scrum. After each sprint the team gathers and creates a list of what went wrong, what went well, and what will they do differently.
- Nikolai: I still do not get it.
- Miki: Just [read this article](https://mszeles.com/how-you-can-become-an-agileish-super-learner-aka-how-you-can-become-a-super-thinker-aka-the-proof-of-concept-poc) and you will understand.
  <br><br>
- Maudience: So, I am happy you improved your memory and thinking process, but how can our readers benefit from that.
- Miki: I have started a live memorization series in which I show the power of the different memorization techniques by combining them, thinking aloud, and involving my audience in the memorization, so they can not just see how they can use it, but they get hands-on experience in them immediately.
- Minnie: What if somebody was not able to participate?
- Miki: I am uploading all my recordings to Youtube. Just [click here to watch them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
- Minnie: What the hell was that?
- Miki: Ups. Sorry. Wrong link. [Here is the right link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUWS3jUWMjk0XdH5oZJr4lw).
- Minnie: What if people would like to ask questions, and get involved in conversations about memorization, learning, and thinking?
- Miki: They can [join my Facebook group called Agileish Szuperhősök](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1045364599695087).
- Minnie: What if they do not speak Hungarian?
- Miki: Then they can [join my English Facebook group called Agileish Superheroes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/488924636292199).
  <a id="open-source-me">
### Open-sourcing myself
- Minnie: That's enough about memorization and learning. Have you done anything else in the last 2 months?
- Miki: Sure. As you know, I am a crazy person, I have open-sourced myself on Fool's day.
- Minnie: Whaaat?
- Miki: I open-sourced my thoughts, writings, and artistic creations, and as I am doing it on Github, I also open-sourced my thinking process, my writing process, and my art creation process thanks to the commit history.
- Minnie: Hmm. I have not heard of anyone else who did that.
- Miki: Me neither.
- Minnie: Is there anything else important about this?
- Miki: I believe this will be the first project on GitHub where people will go to read the comments instead of the content itself.
- Minnie: ???
- Miki: As in all the comments messages I am talking with you Minnie, Nikolai, and all the others.
- Minnie: Cool.
- Nikolai: You are an idiot, Miki.
- Miki: Thank you, my friend.
- Minnie: Where is the project?
- Miki: [Just click here and you will find it!](https://github.com/mszeles/a-hamunish-humanish-thoughtishish)
  <a id="hackernoon-interview">
### Giving an interview to Hackernoon
- Minnie: What else you did do?
- Miki: I gave an interview to Hackernoon.
- Minnie: I know that. [Here is the link!](https://hackernoon.com/i-open-sourced-my-thinking-process-meet-hackernoon-writer-and-test-automation-engineer-miki-szeles)
  <a id="brainish-appish">
### Developing a mind-controlled app and participating in Hashnode Writeathon
- Neveloper: Any programming related?
- Miki: Sure. I have developed an open-source brainwave-based app with which paralyzed people can communicate with their loved ones using a Muse EEG device.
- Neveloper: Finally. I wanted to learn Python for quite a while.
- Maudience: How can our readers learn more about the project?
- Miki: I have written an article about it to participate in the Hashnode Writeathon. [Just click here to read it!](https://mszeles.com/a-brainwave-based-solution-with-which-completely-paralyzed-people-can-communicate-with-their-loved-ones-using-a-muse-eeg-band)
  <a id="craft-conf-giveaway">
### Starting a Craft Conf giveaway
- Nikolai: Ok, I am pretty sure you cannot come up with any other stuff.
- Miki: Are you sure?
- Nikolai: Yes, I am sure Miki.
- Miki: Well, then you are wrong. I have started a Craft Conf conference ticket giveaway.
- Nikolai: Craft conf? Never heard of it.
- Neveloper: It is because you have no idea about conferences and software engineering. Craft Conf is one of the biggest software development conferences in the world, featuring 70+ top-notch experts' talks. 1000+ developers take part each year.
- Maudience: How can our readers participate in this?
- Miki: They have to write an article about anything. [Just click here to read the rules!](https://mszeles.com/do-you-want-to-learn-software-development-from-top-notch-experts-from-all-around-the-world-here-is-your-chance-aka-the-craft-conf-giveaway)
- Maudience: But Miki, the deadline is the 25th of May which is very close.
- Miki: That is true, but they can even participate with an article they have written before up till the 11th of May, the start of the giveaway. They just have to follow the rules.
- Nikolai: A 399€ ticket for something which our readers would do anyway? Where is the catch?
- Miki: The winners have to write a 1000 words article after the conference about the conference.
- Nikolai: I knew it. Nobody will participate.
- Miki: We will see. Most of the fellow hloggers would write an article anyway about it if they participate.
  <br><br>
- Minnie: There is one thing I do not understand. If you do so many things why do you reboot Hashnode Weekly?
- Miki: As I realized I love writing it and I do believe it is valuable for our readers.

## Your Weekly Dose of Harticles
### Today in Spotlight 🔦: Being a Dabbler by Jamie V.
As you might get used to it I always put one article in the spotlight, usually an article with which I can highly relate. This week it is @[Jamie V.](@sigma1)' [The Power of the "Dabbler"](https://sigma1.hashnode.dev/the-power-of-the-dabbler) article. According to Jamie, he was a Dabbler during his whole life. He shares his thoughts about being a dabbler in his article. It is a must-read in my opinion.

I can highly relate to this as I am a dabbler myself too. In the past, I have started a lot of new things. Just to mention a few examples: playing poker, becoming a barista, playing go, photography, running, Lindy Hop, and creating a Facebook group. When I start something I put 100% into it, which has usually resulted in burnout after a few weeks, months, or years.

No matter what, sooner or later I lost my interest and gave up on them. I have considered this a bad thing for decades, up till recently.

Today I see this from a completely different perspective. I believe all of those experiences were valuable. There are many topics on which I gave up, but still, all of them helped me to become the person I am now. And from time to time I move back to a topic like I am photographing and playing go again.

The above-mentioned topics are seemingly unrelated, but as I am always looking for ways to combine my previous learnings I usually find a way, which might result in something unique.

If you read what have I done during the last 2 months, you could see I have started many completely different topics.

Will I give up some of them?

I am almost sure. I have my limits and I cannot handle as many things in parallel.

Will I give up all of them?

I doubt it. As I am doing many things in parallel I believe I can make sure I won't burn out this time.

Which topics will I continue?

I will continue those ones in which I find the most joy, which is usually the topic that gives the most value to my followers.

And now let's see this week's harticles:

### Software Development

- Do you want to learn how you can build a complete Spring-based project from requirements up till conenirezation?

He just posted the 133rd!!!! article in his series:  [Code Smell 133 - Hardcoded IF Conditions](https://hashnode.com/authenticate?next=https://mcsee.hashnode.dev/code-smell-133-hardcoded-if-conditions)
- I do not know anything about Kotlin, so when I saw @[Vincent Tsen](@vtsen)'s [How to Create Singleton Class in Kotlin?](https://vtsen.hashnode.dev/how-to-create-singleton-class-in-kotlin) harticle I felt the urge to read it, especially as I could learn about Kotlin via an example with which I am quite familiar the Singleton design pattern.
- You can learn the ins and outs of pseudocode from @[Mfon.](@themfon)'s [What You Need to Know About Pseudocode](https://hashnode.com/authenticate?next=https://themfon.hashnode.dev/what-you-need-to-know-about-pseudocode) article. I have seen way too much pseudo-code during my university years, but if you are not familiar with them, then this article is highly recommended.
- Do you want to read an inspiring story about how a woman with a tourism background became a software developer? Just read @[Eleanor Opiyo](@iamnellie)'s [Making the big switch to Software development](https://iamnellie.hashnode.dev/making-the-big-switch-to-software-development) harticle.
- Do you want more motivation to become a software developer? Read @[Souvik Das](@storiesbysouvik)'s [My journey of becoming a developer](https://storiesbysouvik.hashnode.dev/my-journey-of-becoming-a-developer) harticle.
- @[Eden AI](@edenai) explains what is OCR, how it works, and what kind of solutions are there on the market and he even provides an example in Javascript in his  [How to use OCR with JavaScript?](https://edenai.hashnode.dev/how-to-use-ocr-with-javascript) post.
- If you are also not familiar with CSS then @[Ravi Kumar](@ravi13)'s [The CSS Box Model](https://ravi13.hashnode.dev/the-css-box-model) is must-read. He explains the CSS box model in an easily understandable way.
- Are you new to Git or GitHub? Read @[Ishita Keshawani](@ishitakeshawani)'s [Learn Git and Github in 5 minutes](https://ishitakeshawani.hashnode.dev/learn-git-and-github-in-5-minutes) harticle to jumpstart your git learning.
- I usually do not like "which is the best" articles as they are biased in most cases, still I read @[idukpaye Alex](@journey-dev)'s harticle [Which Frontend Javascript Framework/library is the Best?](https://journey-dev.hashnode.dev/which-frontend-javascript-frameworklibrary-is-the-best) and I did not regret it.
- Have you ever used a listener in your code? Then most probably you used the Observer design pattern even without noticing it. Learn about the pattern from @[Abdulrhman Elsaed](@apdoelsaed) by reading his [The Observer Pattern](https://apdoelsaed.hashnode.dev/the-observer-pattern) harticle.
- I do not know any other profession which has so many controversial topics as software development. It is possible it is because I am not familiar with other professions, but still @[Joel Tanzi](@jtanzi) was able to [list 5 oddly controversial topics in software development](https://hashnode.com/authenticate?next=https://jtanzi.hashnode.dev/5-oddly-controversial-topics-in-software-development). I even added one more, the "feature vs. bug" never-ending debate.
