HI!

I am Miki Szeles from Hungary, Budapest.

I am an average guy, a single human just like you. A single human with one small twist.

I am a super learner.

## Being a super learner the first time
The fist time, when I was a superlearner was 40 years ago, just right after I was born.

Kids are super learners. They such the information into themselves as a sponge sucks the water.

Babies are touching, smelling, tasting everything. They are plajing with each object they find. They drop it to the 
ground, to hear its sound, to see whether it breaks or not.

Super learning is the ability with which babies extend their knowledge about the world with an extreme speed.

## Losing my superpower
As I got to kindergarden and later school I was taught a differenet method for learning.

I was told I have to repeat things in my head many times in order to memorise it. Unfortunatelly there was nobody 
with me who could tell me that this method is completely flawed.

So I learnt this method. It was enough to get 5s(As) from almost every subject in the school, but it was far not 
enough to get good grades at the university later.

At that time I thought being a super learner is a very important skill.

By now, I know being a super learner is the most important skill for a human.

Why?

Because in case you are a superlearner,you can exponentially increase in everything, no matter what is it exactly.

## My attempts to become a super learner again
I was around 10 years old, when my parents enrolled me in the Silva method for kids course. It was interesting, that 
was the first time I met with the peg lists(Memóriafogasok in Hungarian).

I played with the peg list, but back then I did not see the value of it.

Later I turned towards supernatural. 

I did believe things like telekinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, astral traveling and reality shifting are existing.

After I went to university, I did not believe in this anymore. By going to grammar school I got a new religion 
called SCIENTIST.

I did not believe in anything what was not proven by science.

But before this happened I tried a few things.

### Reiki
I thought regeneration and healing others are a real thing, so I have learnt Reiki. I used Reiki a lot when I was a 
child, and it did great things, but there was no exact thing by which I could say, this is definitely working.

### Silva method
I have visited the normal Silva method course of László Domján. 

It was amazing. This was the second time when I have 
met with brainwaves like alpha, beta, delta and theta. 

The first one was when I had an epileptic seizure and thanks 
to that I had to go to checkups for years. 

During these checkups they have put cold gel on my head, then they have 
attached small electrodes, just to draw an EEG curve. I will talk about this in an upcoming article soon.

Let's get back to the Silva method.

I have seen in live that the Silva method works. You can achieve unbelievable things with that. I even had 2 books 
with the title Agykontrollsikerek, which is a collection of success stories.

### Photo-reading and Mindmaps
In order to improve my learning I tried to learn Photo-reading. First via a series of audiocasettes but later also 
on a Photo-reading course.

This was the time I met with MindMaps. However, it was fun, I did not use it afterward as I thought it is too 
cumbersome to draw something just to remember one simple thing.

Today I am using mindmaps all the time, but in a completely different way. Instead of having one connection between 
elements, I have several connections between all the things in my head.

I tried to employ photo-reading in my life, but I have miserably failed. Despite I failed I learnt 2 very 
important things:

Előolvasás (preview in English), is a crucial point in reading anything. With előolvasás you can immediately 
whether this book is for you or not, but most importantly it can wake up the curiosity of your inner child, which is 
one of the cornerstones of learning.

During előolvasás your inner child comes up with a lot of questions if you let it to do that. Having questions which 
are relevant for us is crucial in the learning process.

I was great in subjects which had a clear logic in it like Mathemathics, Physics, Computer Science and many other.

Ok, I lied. I was only good in those 2 subjects.

But I was struggling with history, grammar, literature, biology, geography and especially with PE as I was 86 kgs 
back then.

I was good at learning practical things, especially if I could use it immediately in practice. For example when I 
have learnt a mathematical formula, I could immediately apply it to calculate some results. That was a good first 
step to memorize something.

## It is possible to become a memory champion
Later I have read [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H4XI5O) from Joshua Foer. That book is amazing. Joshua is a single human just 
like you and me and without any background he was able to become a memory champion. I highly recommend reading that 
book, I will also reread it soon to further boost my already very strong motivation.

### Memorization techniques
I have read multiple books from Dominic O'Brian about memorisation. I  highly recommend reading them, even myself 
will reread them again soon.

I had many attempts with memory palaces, peg lists, associations and number memorising techniques.

#### Peg list
This technique is very simple. You come up with an object for each number. For example 1 looks like a candle, so my 
object for 1 is candle.

For me the number 2 looks like as a pirate's hook on his arm.

Let's say I want to memorize a deck of cards which I did back then. You can read about it on [my former personal blog]
(https://msz.team/3NSGB14). It is in Hungarian, but thanks to Google translate you can read it if you are interested.

To keep it short let's say I want to memorize a queen of heart, and a diamond king in this order.

So I imagine a queen with a crown on her head wearing a robe. The robe is open and I can see a T-shirt on the queen
with the text "I ❤ chocolate cake". To connect it with number 1, I imagine she is eating a pistachio cake which has
a single candle on it.

This is enough, especially as I was able to connect it with a very memorable thing. With the movie "És megint dühbe
jövünk... (Odds and Evens in English)" featuring Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill.

So for the king I imagine a huge room in which there is a hook on the ceiling. A king is clenched his fists on this
hook, to make sure he won't fall down to ground. As the room is completely full of aligators. The king has a huge
diamond in his hand but in order to prevent falling down he drops diamond nad one of the aligators swallows it.

As you can see this is a very effective technique to memorize things in a certain order.

#### The PAO (Person, Action, Object) method
The PAO method is similar to the peg list, but in addition to having objects, you also have actions and persons.

In PAO we do not care about the order of things, but of course you can combine it with the peg list technique.

My first person will be my son Levi. I could reuse the previous image, but to demonstrate how easy is the process 
let's create another image.

So I imagine Levi wearing a robe and a crown, sitting on the iron throne from Game of Thrones eating chocolate from 
a heart shaped box.

The action will be carrying for example. I imagine a burglar who just escaped from a jewelry shop carrying a one-meter-high diamond. He cannot really bring it, so he puts it on a truck and immediately brings it to her queen Sasha, who 
is his love of life.

As you can see, things gt much more memorable in case you extend them with tiny details, like I did with the name Sasha.

Also, as you can see you can create not just single images but also imaginary videos which will make memorisation 
much more efficient.

And let the 3rd card be a 7 of Spade. For me the spade looks like a fan. To connect it with 7 I imagine the seven 
dwarves holding a fan in their hand all of them are fanning Snowwhite as she is very hot.

Well, I have to tell I messed up. However, the above-mentioned thing works pretty well, this is not the PAO method.

So let's revisit the topic.

Person: Levi wearing a robe and a crown, sitting on the iron throne, eating chocolate cake.

In order to use the PAO, Levi have to do something.

So Levi is holding a diamond in his left hand, and a Barbie doll called Stacie (who is dressed as a queen) in the right 
hand (watch out for the tiny details, they make everything much more memorable). In order to have some action too, let's imagine 
Levi throws both of them to see, how far they can get.

The object is a 7 of spade. After Levi has thrown the diamond and the Barbie doll a 7-headed dragon called 
Draco comes in then collects the thingies and bring it back to Levi. Except not. He puts the diamond in his treasure chest and starts 
playing with the Barbie doll, as he is so lonely. He only has a visitor haphazardly. Instead of stamps he is 
collecting shields and swords. This is the perfect opportunity to show it to     

As you can see this technique is very simple but extremely powerful.

#### Memory palace
Memory palaces are highly effective to memorise anything either ordered or unordered list of things. There are 
people who memorised all single bones in the human body using this technique. Of course you can do that without this 
technique, but this ine not just much more effective, but also much more fun.

The memory palace can be either a real place, an imaginary place or even a place from your favourite game.

The idea behind this technique is to put information you want to memorise somewhere in a room.

It is very important to connect the thing you want to memorise with a certain part of your room. For example, I want 
to memorise the word gulyás (Goulash in English and グヤーシュ in Japanese) which is traditional Hungarian food. Maybe even 
you heard about 
it. 😊

**Dear Reader! What is the first word comes into your mind when you hear the word hungarian? Please share it in the
comment section.**

While I was using memory palaces I usually used the place with which I am most familiar with which is our flat.

So in order to get into the flat, I open the door, but an accident happens. There were a bogrács (cauldron in 
English, 大釜 in Japanese) and the door dumped the cauldron and the hall is completely filled with potato, carrot and 
meeat cubes.

That's it.

If you want to memorize the order too, it is important to have a visit order in which you visit the parts of your room.

That's enough about memorisation techniques. Let's talk about the big gun!

### Speed reading
I have tried to learn speed reading 3 times. The first 2 was a complete disaster. I have used tools like Spreeder and 
others with which I was able to boost my reading speed.

But there was a tiny little problem.

I could remember almost nothing.

The fact that I have never known a single person who can really do reading with 700 words per minute with 90% of 
comprehension lead me to the conclusion of speed reading is a hoax.

That is how I lived my last 15 years.

But something changed since then.

My Udemy course library is similar to my Steam library. It is full of never visited courses/games which I bought 
when there was a sale. 

So back then in December I found a course called Super Learner and bought it.

As it is promised I will become a superlearner I immediatelly bought it and started to watch.

It was a disappointment for me. The subject was interesting but I had the feeling it is just talking about things, 
and not giving any guideline to follow.

Then I found out it might be intentional as Jonathan Levi who has created the course founded a company Super Learner 
Academy.

You can enroll to this academy for a nice amount of money. In exchange to that, you will get access to a lot of 
courses. There is a basic and a premium offering, I have decided to go with the premium to get the most value about it.

I have only wathed a small portion of the Super Learner Master Class, as for me it did not provided extra vvalue, 
except an excel sheet, which contains what you should practice when.

So I decided to cancel my subscription. After writing a mail to the support to cancel my subscription I got a mail 
(I guess an automatic mail) from Jonathan LEvi in which he explains why should I stay.

This is a perfect marketing strategy, he was able to convince me to keep the subscription as I was interested in 
productivity boosting about which they also have a course.

I just cancelled my subscription a few days ago, as I am becoming more and more productive since I became an 
agileish super learner.

Despite this I highly recommend giving it a try. If it can onyl improve your learning speed a little bit, it is 
still a great value. And of course you can cancel your subscription anytime, like I did.

I am happily pay even a high price for something which gives me value, but as I am constantly changing it is always 
something different in which I see value at the moment.

I have learnt one very important thing from the Udemy Super Learner course:

Up till you do not have a great memory, there is no pointof learning speedreading, as you will forget everything. 
The book came up with the example of filling a bucket with a water hose. No matter how fast the water is coming, in 
case your bucket is full, then you just waste the water/time by trying to fill it.

The information that you have to improve your memory first was crucial for me.

## Becoming a Super Thinker AKA The Hundred Thinkingish Smurfs Methodish
In case you read my writings you already know I have introduced more than 30 immaginary characters by now. In the 
beginning they were inspired by Edward de Bono (who is a genious)'s Six Thinking Hat, then later I relized there is 
an even better method. 

The method is coming from Peyo who is an even bigger genious than Edward de Bono.

Peyo is the father of the Hupikpk Törpikék (Smurfs in English, スマーフ in Japanese).

But he does not only have 6 hats, but he has more than a 100 smurfs.

So let's see how they connect:
|My character| De Bono Hat|Smurf in Hungarian|Smurf in English|Smurf in Japanese|Attributes|
|------------|---|------------------|----------------| -----------------|----------|
|Minnie|red|Törpilla|Smurfette| スマーフェット|empathy, enthusiasm|
|Nikolai|black|Dulifuli|Grouchy Smurf|Grouchy sumāfu|negativity, critical thinking|
|Mictor|green|Törpingáló|Painter Smurf|画家スマーフ|creativity|
|Metro|blue|thinking about thinking, keeps focus, reflects|
|Not employed yet|yellow|még nincs beazonosítva|not identified yet|まだ特定されていません|
|Miki|white|Miki|Miki|In reality I have a rainbow coloured hat, as I am all my characters together|

My first character was Minnie. I have no idea where she came from. I do not believe in the one and only God as it is 
described by the Bible, but I do believe in a higher intelligence.

At the moment I cannot exclude the possibility of the idea that this came from a higher intelligence, but I will 
revisit my writings in the upcoming days who know maybe I find something just like in [The Mystery Of The Supposedly 
Red ❤ Emoji AKA The Story Of How I Became A Software Developer Detective To Debug The Internet](https://mszeles.
com/the-mystery-of-the-supposedly-red-emoji-aka-the-story-of-how-i-became-a-software-developer-detective-to-debug-the-internet.)

So as at that time my most important feelings were empathy and enthusiasm Minnie came alive.

Almost immediatelly came Nikolai, who was ruled my life for 3 decades.

The appearing of these characters completely change my thinking process. Thanks to De Bono and Peyo no matter what 
exact question/topic we are talking about, I can think crystal clearly.

In the beginning I had to write down everything in a conversational style, then I just separated my thoughts in my 
head by naming the source of the thought.

By now, I can immediatelly tell which of my thoughts coming from whom.

**I do believe we have everybody in our head who has affected our lives in any way.**

Of course the most loud people are our parents, but I have thoughts coming from every single person I interacted 
with in any way.

All the characters were there, and they were talking all the times, but I couldn't hear them as they were talking 
at the same time.

By putting on the white hat, I became a moderator who makes sure everyone has the chance to talk and also makes sure 
that only one character talks at the same time.

By doing this I have become a Super Thinker, it is like having a quantum computer in my brain.

I use this super thinker skill to make the world better for my son Levi, for all the children and for the adults too.

I have many ideas, but I love to think in groups much more, as it is much much much more valuable.

In order to start conversation with people from all around the world, I have decided to make myself open-source.

## Becoming open-source-minded
I am a foolish guy, so on 1st of April, 2022 I have decided to make my mind open-source via GitHub.

I share my thoughtishish, my writingishish and my artisticish creationsishish and as I do it on GitHub I also share 
my thinking process, my writing process and my art creation process.

You can find it here if you are interested. [Just click here!](https://msz.team/3M9yyLV).

In addition to start conversation with open-minden fellow humans I have crated it to have a legacy for my son, Levi, 
for my wife, Panni, for my family, for my friends and also for everybody who is interested in it for the case when 
the time comes, or in case a tram goes through me.

## Being an Agileish Super Learner AKA The Agileish Mind Methodish
As I am an agileish learner, I commit after each iteration.

Approximately 1 week ago Metro joined our team. He is our Scrum Master who is responsible for the retros.
For those who are not coming from the agile world:

Scrum is a methodology for software delopment, but it is universal you can use it almost eveywhere. 

Actually that is what I am doing. My life consists of short sprints, no matter what I do thanks to Metro.

So a Sprint is a 1-6 weeks long etap, during which the team develops the features which gives the most value to the 
customers.

After each Sprint/iteration there is a meeting called retrospectivev.

During this meeting the team creates 3 lists:
1. What went good?
2. What went wrong?
3. What we will do differently?

With this simple process you can make sure your team is continuously improving. Just imagine you have 2 weeks long 
sprints and you can improve 1% in something which is relevant after the retro. This means an 1.296 performance 
multiplier in 1 year and 3.64 multiplier in 5 years.

1% might sound overoptimistic, but believe me it is not.

In the beginning I only applied the retro for my writing after finishing an article. That was already a huge step 
forward.

By now I do a retro after each paragraph, and in addition to that I do a retro for basically everything what I do, 
thanks to this I improve exponentially no matter what I do.

Dear Reader! If there is only one thing you will bring home from this hartcile, I kindly ask you to bring home this:



**Everybody can become a super thinker and also a super learner by following the simple guidelines I have shared 
here!**



In case you are stucked, I will gladly help you just contact me on any of my channels which you can find at the 
bottom of this article.


## The Pomodoroisch Techniqueish
I use the Pomodoroish techniqueish to do iterations, which consists of 2 parts.

1. 5-25 minutes smoking, during which I am thinking.
2. 15min - 3-hour creation and thinking till I am in the flow. My son Levi might ask me to play with him after 15 minutes, but in case my family is sleeping, I could go up till 3 hours.

There are also laonger breaks after a few sessions to have lunch or do this and that.

I am so agileish. I am not only writing my code in iterations but also my creativeish technicalish articles too.

Earlier I had a retro after each article. Now, I have a retrospection after each paragraph.

Thanks to this, I can improve exponentially.

Minnie: Wow, Miki! That sounds amazing!
Nikolai: This is a bullshit.
Mritishish Scientistish: We have proven with my colleagues that Humanish Intelligence (HI) cannot overperform 
Artifical Intelligence (AI) anymore.
Miki: We will see. We will see.
Nikolai: Without any proof this is just a fairy tale. Do you have something?
Miki: Sure! First let tell where I am at the moment.

## Where I am at the moment?
Thanks to the Hundred Thinkingish Smurfs method I feel like Paul Atreides. 

Paul has all his ancestors in his mind, and I do have all my ancestors in my mind, because my parents are in my head,
and they are the improved versions of their ancestors.

Thanks to the Agileish Mind Methodish I feel like Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) on NZT or like Paul Atreides being 
high thanks to the spice.

At the moment I can type as fast as I vocalize the words in my head. This is the current biggest barrier in my 
improvement.

I have contacted Andrea Szabó, who is a Super Learner coach at Jonathan Levi's Superhuman Academy.

I conteacted her to help me get rid of subvocalization (that is the official term for vocalizing the word in your 
head while you are thinking).

Andrea teaches memory techniques and speed reading. I highly recommend to contact her, as the value she provides is 
invaluable. 

I do think you can progress on your own with the methodish I shared here, but in case you need some guidance just 
contact her, or me.

If I can get rid of subvocalization I will be able to think only in images which will give an extreme boost to my 
memory, as the brain can process images in a fraction of a second.

## My plans for the future
So let's see where I am at the moment!

My ultimate goal is to arrive to the point when two humans can communicate with each other only with their thoughts. 

For this I think we will need a temporary solution in which we can convert our thoughts into text and the other 
person can (super) read it.

I will create a GitHub repo with the name The Hamunisch Intelligenceish (HI) Projectis. I will collect all the projects 
in that repo, which helps to make this planet a better place for our children and for us too.

At the moment I have 3 project ideas:
1. A Douglas Adams inspired life simulation game.
2. An universal sign language.
3. Converting brain waves to written text.

I write here about the 3. project but in case you are interested in the others, just drop me a DM.

All of these projects will be open-source. They license type will be the Hamunish Licenseish. To quickly sum it up, 
you can use it for free for any project, even for for-profit goals in case you use it for making the world better.

In case AI will be used in these project, they must be understandable and ethical AI solutions only.

Everybody will have read access (even AI), but it is not allowed for AI to incorporate these projects into their 
learnings.

I would like to find kind and helpful people who are willing to contribute to these projects. Just drop me a DM in 
case 
you are interested! You can find my contact options at the bottom of this article.

Regarding the 3. point I have defined the following goals which will be transformed to HSMARTish goals in the near 
futures.

1. Being able to transfer 0 and 1 to the computer. I do believe the best approach is to define a common languaeg 
   between computers and humans. At the moment we are the smarter ones, so we should speak the computers language first.
2. With this we could convert any thoughts to written texts, even if it is cumbersome.
3. Teach the universalish sign language to the computer, so we can have a conversation with it.
4. Communicate with the computer by transfering the subvocalized words.
5. Communicate with the computer only with images.
6. Communicate with other humans using a middle layer (computer).
7. Direct image based communication between humans.

The concept is working as 3 people from the California University have created such a solution with which they were 
able to recognize with 96% of the words.

Unfortunatelly, it is not open-source as far as I know, and it 

I already borrowed a Muse (1st gen) dry electrode EEG device from Andrea and soon I will order the Muse S. I do 
believe if we reach some goals, we can get Muse to support us with EEG devices. At least I will definitely ask them 
to do that.

With this device you can get the RAW brainwave data in real time. 

I have not written a single line of code, but I found projects with which you can control the computer with blinking.

My plan is to collect all my friends on the [Craft Conf](https://msz.team/37uSJ7Q) about which I will write later. I 
want to collect them to join this project, I would like to put the basic cornerstone of this project by Hungarian minds.

Immediatelly after that, I will open it as an open-source project. Just drop me a DM if you are interested.

So let's get back to Nikola's question

## The proof of the usefulness of techniqueishish I have written above
Andrea Szabó has shawn me a game called [Camera Mind](https://msz.team/3xg0Y2z) on the webpage of the Super Human Academy in which you have to 
memorize the position of colourful circles.

Andre told me she has a student who reached level 102 where she stopped, as in case you can memorize 102 circles you 
can memorize as much as you want.

My goal is to reach 103,and later to reach the final level. At least I guess there is a final level as we will run 
out of empty space at some point.

I had my first session at the very same day.

I had 3 sessions and I have reache level 52, where I miserably failed.

In this video I demonstrate almost all the memorization techniques I have learnt during my life, and I also 
demonstrate how you can use the Agileish methodish in real life.

I am thinking aloud in this video, so you can understand what I am doing.

It is so easy even children can lear it. Actuall yit is much easier to them, as they still have an unimaginable memory.

You can find this video on Youtube. [Just click here!](https://msz.team/3v4dRtL)

## My first ever live Super Learner session

Today at 3 pm (GMT+1), I will have my first ever live session in which I try to reach 103 random circles.

You can ask me anything during this, and I will try to answer it.

I have subscribed to Zoom Pro to raise the person limit to 100.

I believe it will be a full house, as memorisation is the most crucial skill to improve your learning speed.

After the session, I will upload the video to Youtube so everybody can watch it.

I am planning to do this session weekly, so to have subjects.

**I kindly ask you to challenge me. Write memorisation challenges in the comment section, so this way, you can lead the topics of my upcoming online sessions.**

You can join the meeting here. [Just click here to learn how you can exponentially improve your memory each day of your life.](https://msz.team/3rfV3GV).

**Feel free to ask any questions about learning and memorisation in the comment section, and I will do my best to answer them.**
