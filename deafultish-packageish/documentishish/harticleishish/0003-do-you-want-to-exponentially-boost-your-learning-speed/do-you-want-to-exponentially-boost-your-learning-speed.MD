HI!

I am Miki Szeles from Hungary, Budapest.

I am an average guy, a single human just like you. A single human with one small twist.

I am a super learner.

## Being a super learner the first time
The fist time, when I was a superlearner was 40 years ago, just right after I was born.

Kids are super learners. They such the information into themselves as a sponge sucks the water.

Babies are touching, smelling, tasting everything. They are plajing with each object they find. They drop it to the 
ground, to hear its sound, to see whether it breaks or not.

Super learning is the ability with which babies extend their knowledge about the world with an extreme speed.

## Losing my superpower
As I got to kindergarden and later school I was taught a differenet method for learning.

I was told I have to repeat things in my head many times in order to memorise it. Unfortunatelly there was nobody 
with me who could tell me that this method is completely flawed.

So I learnt this method. It was enough to get 5s(As) from almost every subject in the school, but it was far not 
enough to get good grades at the university later.

At that time I thought being a super learner is a very important skill.

By now, I know being a super learner is the most important skill for a human.

Why?

Because in case you are a superlearner,you can exponentially increase in everything, no matter what is it exactly.

## My attempts to become a super learner again
I was around 10 years old, when my parents enrolled me in the Silva method for kids course. It was interesting, that 
was the first time I met with the peg lists(Memóriafogasok in Hungarian).

I played with the peg list, but back then I did not see the value of it.

Later I turned towards supernatural. 

I did believe things like telekinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, astral traveling and reality shifting are existing.

After I went to university, I did not believe in this anymore. By going to grammar school I got a new religion 
called SCIENTIST.

I did not believe in anything what was not proven by science.

But before this happened I tried a few things.

### Reiki
I thought regeneration and healing others are a real thing, so I have learnt Reiki. I used Reiki a lot when I was a 
child, and it did great things, but there was no exact thing by which I could say, this is definitely working.

### Silva method
I have visited the normal Silva method course of László Domján. 

It was amazing. This was the second time when I have 
met with brainwaves like alpha, beta, delta and theta. 

The first one was when I had an epileptic seizure and thanks 
to that I had to go to checkups for years. 

During these checkups they have put cold gel on my head, then they have 
attached small electrodes, just to draw an EEG curve. I will talk about this in an upcoming article soon.

Let's get back to the Silva method.

I have seen in live that the Silva method works. You can achieve unbelievable things with that. I even had 2 books 
with the title Agykontrollsikerek, which is a collection of success stories.

### Photo-reading and Mindmaps
In order to improve my learning I tried to learn Photo-reading. First via a series of audiocasettes but later also 
on a Photo-reading course.

This was the time I met with MindMaps. However, it was fun, I did not use it afterward as I thought it is too 
cumbersome to draw something just to remember one simple thing.

Today I am using mindmaps all the time, but in a completely different way. Instead of having one connection between 
elements, I have several connections between all the things in my head.

I tried to employ photo-reading in my life, but I have miserably failed. Despite I failed I learnt 2 very 
important things:

Előolvasás (preview in English), is a crucial point in reading anything. With előolvasás you can immediately 
whether this book is for you or not, but most importantly it can wake up the curiosity of your inner child, which is 
one of the cornerstones of learning.

During előolvasás your inner child comes up with a lot of questions if you let it to do that. Having questions which 
are relevant for us is crucial in the learning process.

I was great in subjects which had a clear logic in it like Mathemathics, Physics, Computer Science and many other.

Ok, I lied. I was only good in those 2 subjects.

But I was struggling with history, grammar, literature, biology, geography and especially with PE as I was 86 kgs 
back then.

I was good at learning practical things, especially if I could use it immediately in practice. For example when I 
have learnt a mathematical formula, I could immediately apply it to calculate some results. That was a good first 
step to memorize something.

## It is possible to become a memory champion
Later I have read [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H4XI5O) from Joshua Foer. That book is amazing. Joshua is a single human just 
like you and me and without any background he was able to become a memory champion. I highly recommend reading that 
book, I will also reread it soon to further boost my already very strong motivation.

### Memorization techniques
I have read multiple books from Dominic O'Brian about memorisation. I  highly recommend reading them, even myself 
will reread them again soon.

I had many attempts with memory palaces, peg lists, associations and number memorising techniques.

#### Peg list
This technique is very simple. You come up with an object for each number. For example 1 looks like a candle, so my 
object for 1 is candle.

For me the number 2 looks like as a pirate's hook on his arm.

Let's say I want to memorize a deck of cards which I did back then. You can read about it on [my former personal blog]
(https://msz.team/3NSGB14). It is in Hungarian, but thanks to Google translate you can read it if you are interested.

To keep it short let's say I want to memorize a queen of heart, and a diamond king in this order.

So I imagine a queen with a crown on her head wearing a robe. The robe is open and I can see a T-shirt on the queen
with the text "I ❤ chocolate cake". To connect it with number 1, I imagine she is eating a pistachio cake which has
a single candle on it.

This is enough, especially as I was able to connect it with a very memorable thing. With the movie "És megint dühbe
jövünk... (Odds and Evens in English)" featuring Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill.

So for the king I imagine a huge room in which there is a hook on the ceiling. A king is clenched his fists on this
hook, to make sure he won't fall down to ground. As the room is completely full of aligators. The king has a huge
diamond in his hand but in order to prevent falling down he drops diamond nad one of the aligators swallows it.

As you can see this is a very effective technique to memorize things in a certain order.

#### The PAO (Person, Action, Object) method
The PAO method is similar to the peg list, but in addition to having objects, you also have actions and persons.

In PAO we do not care about the order of things, but of course you can combine it with the peg list technique.

My first person will be my son Levi. I could reuse the previous image, but to demonstrate how easy is the process 
let's create another image.

So I imagine Levi wearing a robe and a crown, sitting on the iron throne from Game of Thrones eating chocolate from 
a heart shaped box.

The action will be carrying for example. I imagine a burglar who just escaped from a jewelry shop carrying a one-meter-high diamond. He cannot really bring it, so he puts it on a truck and immediately brings it to her queen Sasha, who 
is his love of life.

As you can see, things gt much more memorable in case you extend them with tiny details, like I did with the name Sasha.

Also, as you can see you can create not just single images but also imaginary videos which will make memorisation 
much more efficient.

And let the 3rd card be a 7 of Spade. For me the spade looks like a fan. To connect it with 7 I imagine the seven 
dwarves holding a fan in their hand all of them are fanning Snowwhite as she is very hot.

Well, I have to tell I messed up. However, the above-mentioned thing works pretty well, this is not the PAO method.

So let's revisit the topic.

Person: Levi wearing a robe and a crown, sitting on the iron throne, eating chocolate cake.

In order to use the PAO, Levi have to do something.

So Levi is holding a diamond in his left hand, and a Barbie doll called Stacie (who is dressed as a queen) in the right 
hand (watch out for the tiny details, they make everything much more memorable). In order to have some action too, let's imagine 
Levi throws both of them to see, how far they can get.

The object is a 7 of spade. After Levi has thrown the diamond and the Barbie doll a 7-headed dragon called 
Draco comes in then collects the thingies and bring it back to Levi. Except not. He puts the diamond in his treasure chest and starts 
playing with the Barbie doll, as he is so lonely. He only has a visitor haphazardly. Instead of stamps he is 
collecting shields and swords. This is the perfect opportunity to show it to     

As you can see this technique is very simple but extremely powerful.

#### Memory palace
Memory palaces are highly effective to memorise anything either ordered or unordered list of things. There are 
people who memorised all single bones in the human body using this technique. Of course you can do that without this 
technique, but this ine not just much more effective, but also much more fun.

The memory palace can be either a real place, an imaginary place or even a place from your favourite game.

The idea behind this technique is to put information you want to memorise somewhere in a room.

It is very important to connect the thing you want to memorise with a certain part of your room. For example, I want 
to memorise the word gulyás (Goulash in English and グヤーシュ in Japanese) which is traditional Hungarian food. Maybe even 
you heard about 
it. 😊

While I was using memory palaces I usually used the place with which I am most familiar with which is our flat.

So in order to get into the flat, I open the door, but an accident happens. There were a bogrács (cauldron in 
English, 大釜 in Japanese) and the door dumped the cauldron and the hall is completely filled with potato, carrot and 
meeat cubes.

That's it.

If you want to memoruze the order too, it is important to have a visit order in which you visit the parts of your room.

That's enough from boring memorisation techniques. Let's talk about speed reading!

### Speed reading

**Dear Reader! What is the first word comes into your mind when you hear the word hungarian? Please share it in the 
comment section.**

To keep it short let's say I want to memorize a queen of heart, and a diamond king.

So I imagine a queen with a crown on her head wearing a robe. The robe is open and I can see a T-shirt on the queen 
with the text "I ❤ chocolate cake". To connect it with number 1, I imagine she is eating a pistachio cake which has 
a single candle on it.

That'a it. This is 

I even blogged about that on [my personal blog](https://msz.team/3NSGB14). It is in Hungarian, but thanks to Google 
translate you can read it if you are interested.

However I was able to memorize the order of a deck of cards using the PAO (Person, Action, Object) object, but I 
could never appl this technique in real life up till recently.

1. Raise curiosity by előolvasás (preview)
2. Ask as many question as possible related to your subject
3. Speed read the book
Create mindmaps in your head.





## My attempts to become a superhero with the super learner ability
learner. 

An efficient solution that is very effective for this problem.

In the video, I also came up with an idea of how to reuse memory palaces without mixing them with previous usages. I have not learnt that technique anywhere. It just popped into my mind. And it works like a charm.

- Minnie: Miki! Won't you share this technique with your readers here?
- Miki: Nope.
- Minnie: Why?
- Miki: I want them to watch the video as I do believe it is equally valuable for kids for adults too.
- Minnie: That is clever.
- Miki: I know.

## The Pomodoroisch Techniqueish
I use the Pomodoroish techniqueish, which consists of 2 parts.

1. 5-25 minutes smoking, during which I am thinking.
2. 15min - 3-hour creation and thinking till I am in the flow. My son Levi might ask me to play with him after 15 minutes, but in case my family is sleeping, I could go up till 3 hours.

There are also laonger breaks after a few sessions to have lunch or do this and that.

I am so agileish. I am not only writing my code in iterations but also my creativeish technicalish articles too.

Earlier I had a retro after each article. Now, I have a retrospection after each paragraph.

Thanks to this, I can improve exponentially.

## How I Made Myself Open source?

I am a crazy guy, so on Fool's Day, I have decided to make myself open-source.

I have decided to share my thoughtishish, writingishish and artish creationish projectishish.

As I am doing it on GitHub, I also share my thinking process, writing process, and art creation process, thanks to the commit history.

You can find it here if you are interested. [Just click here!](https://msz.team/3M9yyLV).

## My First Ever Live Session

Tomorrow at 3 pm (GMT+1), I will have my first ever live session in which I try to reach 103 random circles.

You can ask me anything during this, and I will try to answer it.

I have subscribed to Zoom Pro to raise the person limit to 100.

I believe it will be a full house, as memorisation is the most crucial skill to improve your learning speed.

After the session, I will upload the video to Youtube so everybody can watch it.

I am planning to do this session weekly, so to have subjects.

**I kindly ask you to challenge me. Write memorisation challenges in the comment section, so this way, you can lead the topics of my upcoming online sessions.**

You can join the meeting here. [Just click here to learn how you can exponentially improve your memory each day of your life.](https://msz.team/3rfV3GV).

**Feel free to ask any questions about learning and memorisation in the comment section, and I will do my best to answer them.**
