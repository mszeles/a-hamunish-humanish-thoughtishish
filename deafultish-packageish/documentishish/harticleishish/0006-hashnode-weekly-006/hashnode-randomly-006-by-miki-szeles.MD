- Maudience: Dear reader! Miki likes to read. Miki likes to read a lot. During the reading, he bookmarks all of the harticles he finds insightful, interesting, or fun. Luckily, Miki likes to write. Miki likes to write a lot. So he decided to create a newsletter in which he not just lists the articles, but also writes a few sentences about them, so you can easily find out whether the article is relevant for you or not.

- Minnie: Yuppie. I can't believe it. Another Hashnode Weekly. Finally.
- Miki: Yeah, I am also happy about that.
- Minnie: What happened? Why didn't you post for 2 months?
- Miki: You know, I read 80-100 articles weekly and I realized I could not focus on other things if I am reading so much. I also burnt out on reading a little bit, so luckily I stopped.
- Minnie: Luckily?
- Miki: Luckily.
- Minnie: Why?
- Miki: As I had time to be creative and focus on other topics too.
- Minnie: So what did you do in the last 2 months?
- Miki: Well. Let's see. I have written 9 articles:

- Nikolai: 9 articles in 9 weeks? Such a loser. Earlier you posted daily.
- Miki: Well, you are partially right, but 4 of them are above 20 minutes read time and 2 of them above 30 minutes.
- Nikolai: You are crazy, nobody will read them.
- Miki: Well, I might be a little bit crazy, but I have employed Maudience to make sure we can keep (the attention of) our audience and make sure they can get the most out of our articles if they do not have 10+ minutes.
- Nikolai: Does that work?
- Miki: We will see. We will see, Nikolai!

- Nikolai: So that's all that you did in the last 2 months?
- Miki: Nope. I have worked in my full-time job as a test automation engineer, and also spent a lot of time with my son, Levi.
- Minnie: Yes, family time is very important. The most important one from all the mentioned things. I will make sure you will never lose focus on that.
- Miki: Thanks, Minnie.
- Nikolai: I am still not impressed about what you did. Is there anything else?
- Miki: Yes. I have learnt many many memorization, learning and thinking methods during the last three decades of my life.
- Nikolai: I know. None of them sticked, you gave up using them after a short while.
- Miki: None of them worked up till recently as suddenly everything started to work.
- Nikolai: How is that possible?
- Miki: I have employed Metro.
- Nikolai: Who is he?
- Miki: He is our Scrum master responsible for retros.
- Nikolai: Ah, so he helps with your full-time job?
- Miki: No, he helps in almost everything what I am doing in my life?
- Nikolai: Whaaaaat?
- Miki: No matter what I am doing, I am doing it in iterations
