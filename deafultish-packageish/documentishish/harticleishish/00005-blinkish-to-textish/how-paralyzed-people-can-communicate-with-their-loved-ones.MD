HI!

I am Miki Szeles from Hungary, Budapest. I am a father of my son Levi, husband of my wife Panni and soon to be a happy dog owner.

I am an agileish creativeish technicalish writer and also a software developer and photographer.

I am an agileish superhero with the superpowers of super thinking, super learning and super memorization.

As you might already know, I am not working on my own as I have a team of agileish creativeish thinkingish friends with me to make sure we provide the best immersive experience for you. By now I am working together with around 40 friends.

As this writing is very long, most probably the longest I have ever written, my friend Meading Nexpert gives you some guidelines.
- Meading Nexpert: Hello fellow humans. I have suggestions based on how much time you have.
1.	Read the table of contents and the parts written using bold style, so you can immediately understand what you can get from this article.
2.	Read the backstory so you can learn where I came from, and how I arrived here, and you can also understand my motivation.

Before we continue, please let me share my backstory. DJMic, start the party!
