DISCLAIMER: However I was inspired by Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hat, but the method I use is different.

- Minnie: What will you write about in this article Miki?
- Miki: I will show how I changed my thinking process with the inspiration of Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hat method.
- Minnie: And what will you write?
- Miki: I do not know yet.
- Nikolai: Modifying a well-known and proven technique is the straight way to failure.
- Miki: We will see, Nikolai. We will see. Manality! What are the facts?
- Manality: Miki boosted his thinking process by giving live to us and it makes his thinking much more effective than before. He also knows this and that about Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hat method.
- Miki: Thanks Manality! What do you think Mictor?
- Mictor: Writing is a creative process. Luckily you have me, so you do not have to worry about being creative. Talking about the method by introducing it in practice was a great idea from me.
- Miki. I thought it was my idea.
- Mictor: Nope. I am the creative guy here.
- Maudience: We have introduced so many characters our readers won't understand what is going on. I think it is high time to introduce the team.
- Miki: Alright.

## My Team
- **Minnie**: Minnie is full of emotion, positivity, and empathy. She is the hearth of our team. Her idol is Smurfette. According to Edward de Bono, she wears a **yellowish redish hat**, but she likes variety so she often wears red and yellow tops or trousers. |
- **Nikolai**: Nikolai has very critical thinking. He can find the drawbacks of any idea and he loves irony. According to Edward de Bono, he wears a black hat, but instead of that, he has a black T-shirt with the label Go to Hellish. Nikolai can also be negative, which is definitely against de Bonos's rule for the black hat, but he can leave behind the negativity when needed. His idol is Grouchy smurf.
- **Mictor**: He is the creative guy on the team, or at least he likes to steal my ideas and present them as if they were coming from him. His favorite food and color is mustard. According to Edward de Bono, he has a green hat.
- **Manality**: She eats facts for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Once I found him eating facts from the fridge during the night, but the next day she said she did not remember anything. According to Edward de Bono, she wears a white hat, but as you might already figure out, she does not wear a hat, but she has a white robe instead. She is still looking for her idol.
- **Miki**: I am the one who is controlling the conversations making sure everything goes as planned. I have a very analytic software developer brain, I work hard to improve myself. I think a lot about my thinking process and I also love to share my findings and thoughts with others in the form of articles and also by youtube videos, who knows maybe somebody will find it useful. According to Edward de Bono, I have a blue hat, but I prefer wearing blue jeans and T-shirts.
- **Metro**: He is our Scrum Master responsible for the retro(spective). The retrospective is a meeting coming from agile software development. Metro makes sure I regularly reflect on myself no matter what I am doing.
  During this self-reflection meeting, my team and I collect all the things which went well, and which could have gone better. In the end, we define action items with which we can improve what we are doing. According to de Bono, he has no hat at all as he does not exist in the Six Thinking Hat, still most probably the most useful member of the team.
- **Maudience**: She is responsible for keeping our reader's attention and also to widen our audience. Whenever she detects the conversation became too long or boring then she warns us immediately so we won't lose our readers. No hat.

Miki: So they are the characters that are relevant for this article but I have around a dozen other characters.
